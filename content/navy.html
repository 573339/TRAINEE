    <li>Mission--Varies with the type of combatant ship. Some engage primarily in combat with enemy forces, such as carriers, cruisers, frigates and submarines. Others have supporting roles, such as repairs salvage and delivery of supplies. The Naval Reserve forces also completely and independently maintain and operate many surface combatant ships. Their missions are the same as their active duty counterpart.</li>

        <li>History:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Nov. 14, 1910, Eugene Ely, a civilian pilot took off from a wooden platform built over the bow of the light cruiser USS Birmingham</li>
          <li>March 20, 1922, the <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#uss">USS Langley (CV-1)</a> converted from the collier USS Jupiter (AC-3) was commissioned as the Navy’s first aircraft carrier.</li>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>History:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>The word “Cruiser” was first used by the English in 1651.</li>
          <li>By 1694, the term was used for ships detached from the main fleet to “cruise” and protect the harbor.</li>
          <li>The cruiser as a “named” ship, vice mission, evolved when the world’s navies phased out sail propulsion ships with wooden hulls, creating armored, steel “battleships”.</li>
          <li>With the emergence of naval strategy using the large battleship, the need arose for a middle-size combatant—the cruiser</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Mission:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Perform primarily in a Battle Force role. Multi-mission, Air Warfare (AW), Undersea Warfare (USW), Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) and Surface Warfare (SW). Weapons</li>

      <li class="head-2">Destroyers (DDG)</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>History:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Destroyers came about in the late 1890’s as a defense against the new class of ship, the Torpedo Boat. Initially called the “Torpedo Boat Destroyer”, it was later shortened to Destroyer.</li>
          <li>Before WWII destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for ocean operations.</li>
          <li>After WWII, with the advent of the guided missile, destroyers took on a surface combatant role previously filled by battleships and cruisers.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Mission: provide offensive and defensive support by:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Detecting and engaging enemy submarines, aircraft and surface ships</li>
          <li>Conducting land attacks</li>
          <li>Performing patrol, search and rescue operations.</li>
        </ol>

        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li class="head-2">Frigates (FFG) -- Mission is to:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>History:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>In the 18th century the term “Frigate” referred to ships that were built for speed and rated with at least 28 carriage mounted guns. These guns were mounted on a single deck.</li>
          <li>By the late 19th century, as “iron clad” ships were built; the term was still used because the principle armament was still on a single deck.</li>
          <li>The USS Constitution was one of the six original Frigates built and commissioned for the US Navy in 1794.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Mission:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Protection of shipping; anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups and merchant convoys.</li>
        </ol>

      </ol>
      <li class="head-2">Littoral Combat (LCS)</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>History:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>During the 1990s, the Navy realized the cold war cruisers and destroyers would be vulnerable along coastal waters as new threats materialized and Navy doctrine moved from deep water warfare to littoral operations.</li>
          <li>The initial concept was for a small single mission ship, but as “mission creep” increased it was decided a larger multi-mission ship capable of working close in to coastal waters was needed.</li>
          <li>This multi-mission capability was achieved by introducing the module concept where the ship would change out mission packages to fulfill a specific mission.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Mission:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>With capability to change mission modules, the LCS is capable of countering diesel submarine threats, littoral mine threats and small surface craft attacks.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Weapons:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Both the Freedom and Independence class LCS carry the 57 mm/70 MK BEA systems capable of firing 220 rounds a minute.</li>
          <li>Some mission modules contain weapons systems.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li class="head-2">Mine Warfare Ships</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>History:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Up until 1917, the US Navy used sloops and tugs to locate and clear mines. With the entry into WWI, a special type of ship was needed to locate and clear mines.</li>
          <li>The USS Lapwing (AM-1) was commissioned in 1918, and became the first ship built with the specific mission of locating and clearing mines.</li>
          <li>At the beginning of WWII, a new class of wooden hulled minesweeper was commissioned. The Yard Mine Sweeper (YMS)</li>
          <li>USS YMS-143</li>
          <li>In the early 1980’s the Navy developed a new type minesweeper as part of the Mine Countermeasures Force, the Avenger Class- USS Chief MCM-14</li>

      </ol>
      <li class="head-2">Amphibious ships</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>History:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Prior to WWII, the US Navy did not have a single ocean going ship capable of discharging tanks or heavy equipment without a crane.</li>
          <li>The need to land troops and equipment from the sea forced the United States to focus on developing these specific mission ships.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Mission:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Land large numbers of personnel, equipment, and supplies on enemy shores.</li>

  <li class="head-1">Submarines</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>History</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>In 1861, French inventor Brutus De Villeroi convinced the Union Navy that he could build a submersible warship. The 47-foot, oar-propelled Alligator became the first submersible Navy warship.</li>
      <li>The Alligator was unable to complete its first mission because it was underpowered, unwieldy and unsafe</li>
      <li>In 1900, the Navy purchased and commissioned the USS Holland (SS-1), propelled by a 45-horsepower engine with a 45-hoursepower engine with a speed of 6 knots. The Holland held a crew of six, carried three torpedoes and a topside gun.</li>
      <li>Submarines came into their own during WW II, with their success in destroying enemy shipping in both the Atlantic and Pacific.</li>
      <li>After WW II and during the cold war, the first nuclear powered submarine, USS Nautilus, was constructed. All US Navy submarines today are nuclear powered, with the last diesel submarine (USS Blueback SS-581) decommissioned in 1990.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Mission -- Varies with the class of submarine.</li>
    <li>Classes: The US Navy has three classes of submarines.</li>

          <li>N–Nuclear powered</li>
        </ol>
        <li>OHIO class submarines, as well as early version Los Angeles class submarines, have “sail planes” above water; all others have the “planes” below water.</li>
        <li>OHIO classes are stealth submarines with the primary mission of nuclear deterrence. They are armed with Trident II ballistic missiles and MK 48 torpedoes.</li>
      </ol>
