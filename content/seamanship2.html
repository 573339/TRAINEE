        <ul>
            <li><span class="list-number">a.</span>When going to sea, you will need to secure equipment to prevent damage from rough waters. How equipment is secured depends on the gear and the place of stowage.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="list-number">(1)</span>Use line strong enough to hold the equipment. Make sure the line is in good condition.</li>
                <li><span class="list-number">(2)</span>Belay the objects from at least two points that are near the object.</li>
                <li><span class="list-number">(3)</span>Secure all objects tightly against something solid (such as a bulkhead).</li>
                <li><span class="list-number">(4)</span>Use chafing gear on sharp corners and rough surfaces.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Frequently check all secured lines and tighten as necessary.</li>
