Many agents are heavier than air and will stay close to the ground.</li><li><span class="list-number">e.</span>If indoors and no escape is possible, close all windows and exterior doors; shut down air conditioning or heating systems to prevent air circulation.</li><li><span class="list-number">f.</span>Cover your mouth and nose. If gas masks are not available, use a surgical mask or handkerchief. Soak a cloth in a solution of a tablespoon of baking soda in one cup of water. Not highly effective, but it gives some protection.</li><li><span class="list-number">g.</span>Cover bare arms and legs and bandage any cuts or abrasions.</li><li><span class="list-number">h.</span>If splashed with an agent, wipe it off immediately with lots of warm soapy water or a diluted 10:1 bleach solution.</li><li><span class="list-number">i.</span>If water is not available, use talcum powder or flour to decontaminate liquid agents. Sprinkle liberally over affected skin areas, wait 30 seconds, gently wipe off with a rag or gauze pad.</li><li><span class="list-number">j.</span>Get immediate medical attention, even if the exposure is thought to be limited.</li></ul></ul><li><span class="list-number">MM.</span>Taken Hostage -- You Can Survive!</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>If you are taken hostage, remember your personal conduct can influence treatment in captivity. The Department of State has responsibility for the protection of all U.S. Government (USG) personnel and their dependents, other than those personnel under the command of a U.S. area military commander.</li><li><span class="list-number">2.</span>If kidnapped and taken hostage, the hostage has three very important rules to follow:</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Analyze the problem so as not to aggravate the situation.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Make decisions to keep the situation from worsening.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Maintain discipline to remain on the best terms with the captors.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">3.</span>Preparing The Family</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Have your family affairs in order, including a current will, appropriate powers of attorney, and measures taken to ensure family financial security.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Issues such as continuing the children’s education, family relocation and disposition of property should be discussed with family members.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Your family should know that talking about your official affiliation to non-DoD people may place you, or them, in great danger. Family members should consult with the local public affairs office prior to talking with media or answering any questions.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">4.</span>Stay In Control</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Recognize the moment when resistance is futile. Your instinct may be to struggle, but you should stop when faced with deadly force.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>The moment of attack is the point of maximum danger since your captors are most likely to panic or use excessive force. If they wanted to kill you, they wouldn’t try to capture you.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Regain your composure as soon as possible and recognize your fear. Your captors are probably as apprehensive as you are, so your actions are important.</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>Take mental notes of directions, times of transit, noises, and other factors to identify your location.</li><li><span class="list-number">e.</span>Note the number, physical description, accents, habits, and rank structure of your captors.</li><li><span class="list-number">f.</span>Anticipate isolation and efforts to disorient and confuse you.</li><li><span class="list-number">g.</span>To the extent possible, try to mentally prepare yourself for the situation ahead. Stay mentally active.</li><li><span class="list-number">h.</span>Attempt to secretly leave fingerprints or DNA material (e.g., hair strand with root, drop of blood) in vehicles or places where you are held.</li><li><span class="list-number">i.</span>Your captors must be convinced the US Government will work to obtain your safe release.</li><li><span class="list-number">j.</span>Do not be depressed if negotiation efforts appear to be taking a long time. Remember that your chances of survival actually increase with time.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">5.</span>Dealing With Your Captors</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Do not aggravate them.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Do not get into political or ideological discussions. Listen, but don’t debate.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Try to limit conversation to topics like sports, family, clothing</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>Comply with instructions, but always maintain your dignity. Obedience to orders or commands need not be swift, cheerful, or overtly enthusiastic, but it should be sufficient to maintain a balanced relationship between the hostages and their captors.</li><li><span class="list-number">e.</span>Talk in a normal voice. Avoid whispering when talking to other hostages or raising your voice when taking to a terrorist.</li><li><span class="list-number">f.</span>Attempt to develop a positive relationship with them. Identify those captors with whom you can communicate and attempt to establish a relationship with one or more of them. Try to be seen as an empathetic person, not a symbol of their hatreds.</li><li><span class="list-number">g.</span>Be proud of your heritage, government, and military association, but use discretion and don’t be offensive.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">6.</span>Keep Occupied</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Exercise daily.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Read anything and everything.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Eat what is offered to you. You must maintain your strength.</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>Establish a slow, methodical routine for every task.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">7.</span>Being Interrogated</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>If you need to avoid answering questions to protect sensitive information, take a simple, tenable position you will be able to remember and maintain.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Be polite and keep your temper.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Give short answers. Talk freely about nonessential matters, but be guarded when conversations turn to matters of substance.</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>Do not be lulled by a friendly approach. Remember that one terrorist may play “good guy” and one “bad guy”. This is the most common interrogation technique.</li><li><span class="list-number">e.</span>Briefly, affirm your belief in basic democratic principles.</li><li><span class="list-number">f.</span>Avoid emotionally charged topics of religion, economics, and politics.</li><li><span class="list-number">g.</span>If forced to present terrorist demands to authorities, in writing or on tape, state clearly that the demands are from your captors.</li><li><span class="list-number">h.</span>Maintain dignity and avoid making a plea on your behalf.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">8.</span>During Rescue</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Drop to the floor and be still. Avoid sudden moves. Wait for instruction.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Once released, avoid derogatory comments about your captors; such remarks will only make things harder for those still held captive.</li></ul></ul></ul>
