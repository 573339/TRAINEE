   <li>Recent Examples of Terrorist Situations and Lessons Learned
   <ol type="a">
   <li>A large concentration of American troops was a lucrative target for terrorists in Beirut.
    <ol>
<li>Beirut, Lebanon, 23 Oct 1983:  Shiite suicide bombers exploded a truck near U.S. military barracks killing 244 Marines.</li>
<li>Following this attack, DoD placed greater emphasis on the use of vehicle barriers and reexamined the rules of engagement for use of deadly force.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Terrorists murdered Navy Diver Robert Stethem because he was U.S. Military.
<ol>
<li>TWA flight 847, 14 June 1985, Two well-dressed terrorists smuggled two hand grenades and a 9-mm pistol onboard the flight and hijacked the plane, when collecting identification, killed U.S. Navy Diver Robert Stethem.</li>
<li>Some terrorist focus their hatred on the U.S. military.  Robert Stethem was singled out because the U.S. Marine role in Lebanon in 1982 and 1982.</li>
<li>Terrorists attack U.S. troops of all ranks and services.  Generally, you should blend in and not be an obvious target.  Try to avoid the most exposed locations in an aircraft, the aisle seats at the front and rear.  Conceal your military ID and travel on a tourist passport.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>US troops at a Berlin discotheque did not know they were targets of international terrorists.
<ol>
<li>Berlin, Germany, 5 April 1986:  A Libyan terrorist bomb killed two U.S. Sergeants and a Turkish woman and injured 230 others in the La Bells discotheque.  No one noticed a suitcase packed with explosives in the bathroom.</li>
<li>Local threat conditions in Berlin gave little warning of the attack.</li>
<li>Be alert even when local conditions are not threatening.  An alert observer might have noticed the suspicious suitcase in the bathroom.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>America awoke to the reality of domestic terrorism with the attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
<ol>
<li>Oklahoma City, 19 April 1995:  A truck-bomb exploded outside the Federal Building killing 168 persons.  Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were later convicted of the crime.</li>
<li>This act of domestic terrorism demonstrated the U.S. homeland is indeed vulnerable to attack.  The emergency response involved a multitude of federal, state and local agencies and inspired intensified efforts to coordinate and strengthen response capabilities.</li>
<li>Michael Fortier, an acquaintance of McVeigh and Nichols, testified for the prosecution in exchange for a reduced sentence for his failure to act on his prior knowledge of the conspiracy.</li>
<li>If you know of or suspect plans for violence, it is your obligation to notify authorities.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The attack on U.S. troops at Khobar Towers led DoD efforts to improve the anti-terrorism capabilities of US Forces.
<ol>
<li>Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 25 June 1996:  An Islamic militant group exploded a truck-bomb outside the Khobar Towers U.S. military complex killing 19 service members and injuring 515.</li>
<li>Terrorists can mount devastating attacks anywhere.  Unfortunately, unit security measures did not prevent this attack; but alert guards saved many lives.</li>
<li>DoD investigated the attack and implemented new programs to promote the safety of U.S. forces worldwide.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The attack on the USS Cole highlighted the need for better anti-terrorism measures for U.S. Forces in transit ports.
<ol>
<li>Aden, Yemen, 12 October 2000:  The U.S Navy destroyer, USS Cole, was heavily damaged when a small boat carrying two terrorists pulled alongside the ship and exploded, killing seventeen sailors.</li>
<li>The attackers showed no sign of hostile intent before the explosion and crewmembers believed the craft was involved in routine harbor activities.</li>
<li>The attack illustrated the way terrorist observe the routine patterns of their targets and use simple but deadly tactics to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The attacks on September 11, 2001, redefined the American understanding of terrorism.
<ol>
<li>New York City; Arlington, Virginia; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania:
<ol type="a">
<li>An American Airlines Boeing 767 and a United Airlines Boeing 767 were hijacked and flown into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center, New York City; both towers collapsed.</li>
<li>An American Airlines Boeing 757 was also hijacked and crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.</li>
<li>A United Airlines Boeing 757 was hijacked but passengers overcame the hijackers; the plane crashed near Shanksville. Pennsylvania.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Suicidal tactics now force all victims to make a critical decision.  When faced with certain death, active resistance against suicidal terrorists may be the best hope of survival and only chance to prevent the devastating results of a successful terror attack.  Courageous resistance by the passengers on Flight 93 probably prevented even more horrific consequences.</li>
