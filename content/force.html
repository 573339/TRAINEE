 <li class="head-1">Introduction</li>
 <li class="head-1">Recent Examples of Terrorist Situations and Lessons Learned</li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li>A large concentration of American troops was a lucrative target for terrorists in Beirut.</li>
   <ol>
    <li>Beirut, Lebanon, 23 Oct 1983:  Shiite suicide bombers exploded a truck near U.S. military barracks killing 244 Marines.</li>
    <li>Following this attack, DoD placed greater emphasis on the use of vehicle barriers and reexamined the rules of engagement for use of deadly force.</li>
  </ol>


  <li>Terrorists murdered Navy Diver Robert Stethem because he was U.S. Military.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>TWA flight 847, 14 June 1985, Two well-dressed terrorists smuggled two hand grenades and a 9-mm pistol onboard the flight and hijacked the plane, when collecting identification, killed U.S. Navy Diver Robert Stethem.</li>
    <li>Some terrorist focus their hatred on the U.S. military.  Robert Stethem was singled out because the U.S. Marine role in Lebanon in 1982 and 1982.</li>
    <li>Terrorists attack U.S. troops of all ranks and services.  Generally, you should blend in and not be an obvious target.  Try to avoid the most exposed locations in an aircraft, the aisle seats at the front and rear.  Conceal your military ID and travel on a tourist passport.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>US troops at a Berlin discotheque did not know they were targets of international terrorists.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Berlin, Germany, 5 April 1986:  A Libyan terrorist bomb killed two U.S. Sergeants and a Turkish woman and injured 230 others in the La Bells discotheque.  No one noticed a suitcase packed with explosives in the bathroom.</li>
    <li>Local threat conditions in Berlin gave little warning of the attack.</li>
    <li>Be alert even when local conditions are not threatening.  An alert observer might have noticed the suspicious suitcase in the bathroom.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <li>America awoke to the reality of domestic terrorism with the attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Oklahoma City, 19 April 1995:  A truck-bomb exploded outside the Federal Building killing 168 persons.  Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were later convicted of the crime.</li>
    <li>This act of domestic terrorism demonstrated the U.S. homeland is indeed vulnerable to attack.  The emergency response involved a multitude of federal, state and local agencies and inspired intensified efforts to coordinate and strengthen response capabilities.</li>
    <li>Michael Fortier, an acquaintance of McVeigh and Nichols, testified for the prosecution in exchange for a reduced sentence for his failure to act on his prior knowledge of the conspiracy.</li>
    <li>If you know of or suspect plans for violence, it is your obligation to notify authorities.</li>
  </ol>


  <li>The attack on U.S. troops at Khobar Towers led DoD efforts to improve the anti-terrorism capabilities of US Forces.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 25 June 1996:  An Islamic militant group exploded a truck-bomb outside the Khobar Towers U.S. military complex killing 19 service members and injuring 515.</li>
    <li>Terrorists can mount devastating attacks anywhere.  Unfortunately, unit security measures did not prevent this attack; but alert guards saved many lives.</li>
    <li>DoD investigated the attack and implemented new programs to promote the safety of U.S. forces worldwide.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>The attack on the USS Cole highlighted the need for better anti-terrorism measures for U.S. Forces in transit ports.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Aden, Yemen, 12 October 2000:  The U.S Navy destroyer, USS Cole, was heavily damaged when a small boat carrying two terrorists pulled alongside the ship and exploded, killing seventeen sailors.</li>
    <li>The attackers showed no sign of hostile intent before the explosion and crewmembers believed the craft was involved in routine harbor activities.</li>
    <li>The attack illustrated the way terrorist observe the routine patterns of their targets and use simple but deadly tactics to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>The attacks on September 11, 2001, redefined the American understanding of terrorism.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>New York City; Arlington, Virginia; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania:</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>An American Airlines Boeing 767 and a United Airlines Boeing 767 were hijacked and flown into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center, New York City; both towers collapsed.</li>
      <li>An American Airlines Boeing 757 was also hijacked and crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.</li>
      <li>A United Airlines Boeing 757 was hijacked but passengers overcame the hijackers; the plane crashed near Shanksville. Pennsylvania.</li>
    </ol>

    <li>Suicidal tactics now force all victims to make a critical decision.  When faced with certain death, active resistance against suicidal terrorists may be the best hope of survival and only chance to prevent the devastating results of a successful terror attack.  Courageous resistance by the passengers on Flight 93 probably prevented even more horrific consequences.</li>
  </ol>

<li class="head-1"><p>Procedures for Receiving a Bomb Threat via Telephone</p><p>If you receive a bomb threat via a telephone call, use the following procedures:</p></li>
<ol type="a">
  <li>As you talk, try to complete the &ldquo;Telephonic Threat Complaint&rdquo; located near Navy telephones.</li>
  <li>Try to keep a word-for-word record of the conversation.</li>
  <li>To obtain more information, attempt to keep the caller talking as long as possible.  Ask the caller:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>When will the bomb go off?</li>
    <li>Where is the bomb located?</li>
    <li>What kind of bomb is it?</li>
    <li>What does the bomb look like?</li>
    <li>From where are you calling?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>If the caller requests to talk to another person, permit them to do so.  If possible, monitor the conversation.</li>
  <li>Upon completion of the call, hang up the telephone; then pick up the same phone and immediately dial *57; however, do NOT dial 9 first.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>This activates a trace on the phone call.</li>
    <li>Dial *57 immediately following the bomb threat phone call; if another call comes in the meanwhile, the phone trace will not work.</li>
    <li>An automated message will tell you whether the call was successfully traced and provide further instructions.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>Alert security or the officer of the deck about the bomb threat.</li>
  <li>When aboard ship, procedures may vary.</li>

                    <li>Avoid spontaneous gatherings or demonstrations.</li>
                    <li>Stay away from known trouble, disreputable places, or other high-risk areas. Visit reputable establishments.</li>

                  <p>Vehicle Inspection Tips:  Every time you use your automobile, you should conduct a precautionary inspection. Make a habit of checking the vehicle and the surrounding area before entering and starting the vehicle.</p>
                  <ul class="circle-bullet">
                    <li>Before entering your vehicle, check the exterior for fingerprints, smudges, scratches or other signs of tampering. Ensure wheel log nuts are tight. Examine tires for stress marks and any evidence of tampering.</li>
                    <li>Check electronic tampering device (alarm system) if installed. An inexpensive option is to place transparent tape on the doors, hood and trunk of your vehicle to alert you to tampering.</li>
                    <li>Always look inside the vehicle before you move inside. Check the interior of the vehicle for things out of place. Look for suspicious or unfamiliar items.</li>
                    <li>Consider the following steps to prevent potential vehicle tampering.

                        <li>Use a locking fuel cap.</li>
                        <li>Install two bolts (perpendicular to each other) through the exhaust pipe. This prevents the insertion of explosives in the tail pipe.</li>
                        <li>Install an intrusion alarm.</li>
                        <li>Only use steel-belted radial tires for your vehicle. You may also consider the use of &ldquo;run-flat&rdquo; tires.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>If you find something out of the ordinary, DO NOT TOUCH IT. Contact the local authorities to report your findings.</li>

                      <p>Air travel, particularly through high-risk airports or countries, poses security problems different from those of ground transportation. Simple precautions can reduce your vulnerability to a terrorist assault.</p>
                      <p><strong>Making Travel Arrangements</strong></p>
                      <ul class="circle-bullet">
                        <li>Get an area of responsibility (AOR)-specific threat briefing from your security officer, anti-terrorism officer (ATO), or the appropriate counterintelligence or security organization prior to traveling. This briefing is mandatory prior to overseas travel and must occur within three months prior to travel. It should also include any AOR-specific AT requirements as directed by the geographic combatant commander. Most geographic combatant commanders put useful information on their Internet sites. Your force protection officer will know which areas DoD considers a high-risk area.</li>
                        <li>Before traveling, consult the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide to ensure you know and meet all requirements for travel to a particular country.</li>
                        <li>Use military air or U.S. flag carriers.</li>
                        <li>Avoid scheduling through high-risk areas; if necessary, use foreign flag airlines and/or indirect routing to avoid high-risk airports.</li>
                        <li>Do not use rank or military address on tickets, travel documents, or hotel reservations.</li>
                        <li>Select window seat; they offer more protection since aisle seats are closer to the hijackers&#8217; movements up and down the aisle.</li>
                        <li>Mid-cabin seats offer more protection since they are farther from hostile action near the cockpit and at the rear of the cabin.</li>
                        <li>Seats at an emergency exit may provide an opportunity to escape.</li>
                        <li>Avoid off-base hotels. If available, use government quarters or contracted hotels.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p><strong>Personal Identification</strong></p>
                      <ul class="circle-bullet">
                        <li>Do not discuss your military affiliation, job titles, or responsibilities with strangers.</li>
                        <li>You must have proper identification to show airline and immigration officials.</li>
                        <li>Consider using a tourist passport if you have one with the necessary visas, provided the country you are visiting allows it.</li>
                        <li>If you use a tourist passport, consider placing your official passport, military ID, travel orders, and related documents in your checked luggage, not in your wallet or briefcase.</li>
                        <li>If you carry your official passport, military ID, travel orders, and related documents, select a hiding place onboard the aircraft to &ldquo;ditch&rdquo; them in case of a hijacking. (The inner part of the window may be a quick and effective place.)</li>
                        <li>Do not carry classified documents unless they are absolutely mission essential. E-mail documents ahead whenever possible or use alternate shipment means.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p><strong>Luggage</strong></p>
                      <ul class="circle-bullet">
                        <li>Use plain, civilian luggage; avoid military-looking bags, B-4 bags, duffel bags, etc.</li>
                        <li>Remove all military patches, logos or decals from your luggage and briefcase.</li>
                        <li>Ensure luggage tags do not show your rank or military address.</li>
                        <li>Do not carry official papers in your briefcase. If official papers must be carried, place them in a sealed, non-descript folder in your briefcase.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>
                      <ul class="circle-bullet">
                        <li>Travel in conservative civilian clothing when using commercial transportation or military airlift if you are to connect with a flight at a commercial terminal in a high-risk area. Some geographic combatant commanders, including U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), have imposed restrictions on the wearing of military uniforms aboard commercial aircraft or vessels within their respective AOR. Check requirements before traveling.</li>
                        <li>Do not wear distinct military items such as organizational shirts, caps or military issue shoes or glasses.</li>
                        <li>Do not wear U.S. identified items such as cowboy hats or boots, baseball caps, American logo T-shirts, jackets or sweatshirts.</li>
                        <li>Wear a long-sleeved shirt if you have visible U.S.-affiliated tattoos.</li>
                        <li>Do not get a fresh, close military haircut before going on international trips.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p><strong>Precautions At The Airport</strong></p>
                      <ul class="circle-bullet">
                        <li>Arrive early and watch for suspicious activity.</li>
                        <li>Look for nervous passengers who maintain eye contact with others from a distance.</li>
                        <li>Observe what people are carrying. Note behavior not consistent with that of others in the area.</li>
                        <li>No matter where you are in the terminal, identify objects suitable for cover in the event of attack. Pillars, trash cans, luggage, large planters, counters, and furniture can provide protection.</li>
                        <li>Do not linger near open public areas. Proceed through security checkpoints as soon as possible in order to be in a more secure area.</li>
                        <li>Avoid secluded areas that provide concealment for attackers.</li>
                        <li>Be aware of unattended baggage anywhere in the terminal.</li>
                        <li>Be extremely observant of personal carry-on luggage. Thefts of briefcases designed for laptop computers are increasing at airports worldwide. Likewise, luggage not properly guarded provides an opportunity for a terrorist to place an unwanted object or device in your carry-on bag. As much as possible, do not pack anything you cannot afford to lose; if the documents are important, make a copy and carry the copy.</li>
                        <li>Observe the baggage claim area from a distance and claim your luggage at first opportunity, without force you way through large crowds. Precede to the customs lines at the edge of the crowd.</li>
                        <li>Report suspicious activity to the airport security personnel.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p><strong>Actions If Attacked In An Airport</strong></p>
                      <ul class="circle-bullet">
                        <li>Dive for cover. Do not run. Running increases the probability of shrapnel hitting vital organs, or the head.</li>
                        <li>If you must move, crawl, and stay low to the ground, using available cover. If the threat is from weapons fire, avoid lying on floors or standing along walls as ricocheting bullets and projectiles tend to &ldquo;hug&rdquo; floors and walls.</li>
                        <li>If you see grenades, seek immediate cover; lay flat on the floor, feet and knees tightly together, with soles toward the grenade. In this position, your shoes, feet and legs protect the rest of your body. Shrapnel will rise in a cone from the point of detonation, passing over your body.</li>
                        <li>Place arms and elbows next to your ribcage to protect your lungs, heart, and chest. Cover your ears and head with your hands to protect neck, and chest. Cover your ears and head with your hands to protect neck, arteries, ears, and skull.</li>
                        <li>Responding security personnel will not be able to distinguish you from attackers. Do not attempt to assist them in any way. Lie still until told to get up.
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Actions If Hijacked</strong></p>
                        <ul class="circle-bullet">
                          <li>Determining the best response in a hostage situation is a critical judgment call. Passengers need to remain extremely alert and rational to try to understand the intentions of the hijackers. Sitting quietly may be prudent in most circumstances, but it is conceivable the situation may require actions to not allow hijackers to take control of the aircraft. In all situations, it is important for individuals to remain alert to unexpected events, think clearly, and act responsibly.</li>
                          <li>Remain calm; be polite and cooperate with your captors.</li>
                          <li>Be aware that all hijackers may not reveal themselves at the same time. A lone hijacker may be used to draw out security personnel for neutralization by other hijackers.</li>
                          <li>Surrender your tourist passport in response to a general demand for identification.</li>
                          <li>Do not offer any information; confirm your military status only if directly confronted with the fact. Be prepared to explain that you always travel on your personal passport that no deceit was intended.</li>
                          <li>Discreetly dispose of any military or U.S.-affiliated documents.</li>
                          <li>Do not draw attention to yourself with sudden body movements, verbal remarks, or hostile looks.</li>
                          <li>Prepare yourself for possible verbal and physical abuse and deprivation of food, drink, and sanitary conditions.</li>
                          <li>If permitted, read, sleep, or write to occupy your time.</li>
                          <li>Discreetly observe your captors and memorize their physical descriptions. Include voice patterns and language distinctions, as well as clothing and unique physical characteristics. Observe how they are armed.</li>
                          <li>If possible, observe if the pilots remain in control of the aircraft.</li>
                          <li>Be aware that there could be federal authorities, such as Air Marshals, on the aircraft who may better suited to take action.</li>
                          <li>If an Air Marshal or flight attendant requests your assistance while taking action, help them as best you can.</li>
                          <li>During rescue attempts, stay low in a seated, or &ldquo;crash&rdquo; position, until told to rise and cooperate with all instructions from the rescuers.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h4 class="section"><strong>TIPS FOR ACTIVE SHOOTER RESPONSE</strong></h4>
                        <p>Active shooters are individuals who attempt to kill people in confined and populated areas, often displaying no pattern in their selection of victims. It is not an uncommon terrorist tactic. Active shooter situations tend to be unpredictable and evolve quickly, often before law enforcement personnel arrive. To increase you and your family’s chance of survival in an active shooter situation, you should familiarize yourself with the following information.</p>

                        <p><strong>Indicators Of A Potential Active Shooter</strong></p>
                        <ul class="circle-bullet">
                          <li>Early recognition of a threat can prevent an incident. The following are pre-attack indicators for a potential active shooter: (This list is not all inclusive, nor should it be used to diagnose violent tendencies)
                            <ul class="circle-dot">
                              <li>Anti-American statements asserting that U.S. policy and authority is illegitimate.</li>
                              <li>Aggression or threats towards coworkers.</li>
                              <li>Presence of unauthorized weapons.</li>
                              <li>Attempts to communicate with U.S. enemies.</li>
                              <li>Unfounded allegations of U.S. persecution or prejudice against a minority group or religion.</li>
                              <li>Abnormal mood swings or depression, withdrawn behavior, decrease in hygiene, paranoia (i.e. “everyone is against me”), increased use of alcohol or illegal drugs.</li>
                              <li>Suicidal remarks or comments about &ldquo;putting things in order.&rdquo;</li>
                              <li>Repeated violations of policies, regulations, or laws.</li>
                              <li>Talk of severe financial problems.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>History indicates that individuals that have become active shooters in a workplace display potentially violent behavior over time. If you recognize these behaviors, inform your supervisor. If you perceive an immediate threat, alert unit security.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <p><strong>Evacuate</strong><p>
                            <p>You need to quickly determine the most reasonable way to protect your life, as well as those around you, whenever possible. If you can escape, consider the following:</p>

                              <li>Have an escape route and plan in mind.</li>
                              <li>Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow.</li>
                              <li>Leave your belongings behind.</li>
                              <li>Help others escape, if possible.</li>
                              <li>Prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be.</li>
                              <li>Keep your hands visible.</li>
                              <li>Follow the instructions of security personnel.</li>
                              <li>Do not attempt to move wounded people.</li>
                              <li>Call emergency personnel when you are safe.</li>

                            <p><strong>Shelter In Place</strong></p>
                            <ul class="circle-bullet">
                              <li>If evacuation is not possible, find a place where the active shooter is less likely to find you. The place you choose should:</li>
                              <ul class="circle-dot">
                                <li>Be out of the active shooter&#8217;s view.</li>
                                <li>Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e. an office with a closed and locked door).</li>
                                <li>Not trap you or restrict your options for movement.</li>

                              <li>Lock the door, silence your cell phone, hide behind large items, remain quiet and calm, and call emergency personnel. If you are not able to speak, leave the line open to allow the dispatcher to listen.</li>
                              <li>If you get attacked, you can adapt your response to the type of weapon being used by an attacker:</li>
                              <ul class="circle-dot">
                                <li>Ricocheting bullets tend to hug the floor; crouching (not lying) on the floor may reduce exposure.</li>
                                <li>Grenade shrapnel rises from the detonation location; lying on the floor reduces exposure and having feet toward the blast may protect your head.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <p><strong>Take Action Against The Active Shooter</strong></p>

                                  <li>Chose a hotel for safety. Obtain a recommendation from the US Embassy or unit security officer.</li>
                                  <li>Consider the surrounding neighborhood, proximity to police, and reputation for good administration.</li>
                                </ul>

                                  <li>Request a different room upon check-in; this may protect you from someone who managed to get your room number from a reservation.</li>
                                  <li>Change rooms every few days to be more unpredictable if you suspect you are at risk.</li>
                                  <li>Choose a room that opens to the hotel interior; threat activities are deterred by the observation of hotel staff. Exterior entrances may be less protected.</li>

                                  <li>Broad surveillance begins with less trained observers, local recruits, and informants.</li>
                                  <li>When prospective targets are identified, surveillance is intensified and focused, often with more expert operatives.</li>
                                  <li>As planning advances, terrorists may take pictures and perform walk-through rehearsal of actions.</li>
                                  <li>As the date of attack approaches, surveillance may become more secretive and limited, consequently, harder to detect.</li>
                                  <li>Surveillance may be on foot or in vehicles.</li>
                                  <li>A surveillance team is harder to detect.</li>
                                  <li>Surveillance is a critical pre-attack activity and a top priority for security programs.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>Detection of Surveillance</strong></p>

                                  <li>Be familiar with normal surroundings so you can recognize abnormal things.</li>
                                  <li>Examples of undercover surveillance include individuals posing as utility workers, street vendors, people waiting for a bus, or vehicle drive-byes.</li>
                                  <li>Look for familiar faces among strangers and repeated vehicle sightings.</li>

                                  <li>If you are followed on foot, change your pace or pause to window shop and note if the suspicious individual pauses.</li>
                                  <li>Retrace your steps and look for familiar faces.</li>
                                  <li>An alert demeanor implies you are a harder target and is deterrence to surveillance.</li>
                                  <li>If you suspect you are under surveillance, move directly to a secure location and report details to security personnel.</li>

                                  <li>If the object has already been moved, place the letter or package in a plastic bag or some other container to prevent leakage of contents.  If you are not certain whether a package or letter has been moved, avoid touching or moving it.</li>
                                  <li>If handling mail suspected of containing chemical or biological contaminants, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.</li>

                                  <li>Medical attention should be sought immediately, even if exposure is thought to be limited.</li>
                                  <li>Many chemical agents will break down when exposed to sun, diluted with water, or dissipated in high winds.</li>
                                  <li>Evacuation upwind from the area of attack is always advisable, unless you are equipped with a proper breathing device and protective clothing.</li>

                                  <li>A chemical attack or incident may not be immediately apparent. Many agents are odorless and colorless.</li>

                                    <li>Protection of breathing airways is key. Unless you have a gas mask, the only sure way to protect an airway is to get away from the source of the agent. While evacuating, cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief, coat sleeve, or any piece of cloth to provide some means of protection.</li>
                                    <li>Stay alert. Early detection enhances survival.</li>
                                    <li>Move upwind from the source of attack.</li>
                                    <li>If evacuation is impossible, move outdoors or to a room on a higher floor. Many agents are heavier than air and will stay close to the ground.</li>
                                    <li>If indoors and no escape is possible, close all windows and exterior doors; shut down air conditioning or heating systems to prevent air circulation.</li>
                                    <li>Cover your mouth and nose. If gas masks are not available, use a surgical mask or handkerchief. Soak a cloth in a solution of a tablespoon of baking soda in one cup of water. Not highly effective, but it gives some protection.</li>
                                    <li>Cover bare arms and legs and bandage any cuts or abrasions.</li>
                                    <li>If splashed with an agent, wipe it off immediately with lots of warm soapy water or a diluted 10:1 bleach solution.</li>
                                    <li>If water is not available, use talcum powder or flour to decontaminate liquid agents. Sprinkle liberally over affected skin areas, wait 30 seconds, gently wipe off with a rag or gauze pad.</li>

                                  <h4 class="section"><strong>TAKEN HOSTAGE -- YOU CAN SURVIVE!</strong></h4>
                                  <p>If you are taken hostage, remember your personal conduct can influence treatment in captivity. The Department of State has responsibility for the protection of all U.S. Government (USG) personnel and their dependents, other than those personnel under the5 command of a U.S. area military commander. If kidnapped and taken hostage, the hostage has three very important rules to follow:</p>
                                  <ul class="circle-bullet">
                                    <li>Analyze the problem so as not to aggravate the situation.</li>
                                    <li>Make decisions to keep the situation from worsening.</li>
                                    <li>Maintain discipline to remain on the best terms with the captors.</li>
                                  </ul>


                                  <p><strong>Preparing The Family</strong></p>
                                  <ul class="circle-bullet">
                                    <li>Have your family affairs in order, including a current will, appropriate powers of attorney, and measures taken to ensure family financial security.</li>
                                    <li>Issues such as continuing the children&#8217;s education, family relocation and disposition of property should be discussed with family members.</li>
                                    <li>Your family should know that talking about your official affiliation to non-DoD people may place you, or them, in great danger. Family members should consult with the local public affairs office prior to talking with media or answering any questions.</li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <p><strong>Stay In Control</strong></p>
                                  <ul class="circle-bullet">
                                    <li>Recognize the moment when resistance is futile. Your instinct may be to struggle, but you should stop when faced with deadly force.</li>
                                    <li>The moment of attack is the point of maximum danger since your captors are most likely to panic or use excessive force. If they wanted to kill you, they wouldn&#8217;t try to capture you.</li>
                                    <li>Regain your composure as soon as possible and recognize your fear. Your captors are probably as apprehensive as you are, so your actions are important.</li>
                                    <li>Take mental notes of directions, times of transit, noises, and other factors to identify your location.</li>
                                    <li>Note the number, physical description, accents, habits, and rank structure of your captors.</li>
                                    <li>Anticipate isolation and efforts to disorient and confuse you.</li>
                                    <li>To the extent possible, try to mentally prepare yourself for the situation ahead. Stay mentally active.</li>
                                    <li>Attempt to secretly leave fingerprints or DNA material (e.g., hair strand with root, drop of blood) in vehicles or places where you are held.</li>
                                    <li>Your captors must be convinced the US Government will work to obtain your safe release.</li>
                                    <li>Do not be depressed if negotiation efforts appear to be taking a long time. Remember that your chances of survival actually increase with time.</li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <p><strong>Dealing With Your Captors</strong></p>
                                  <ul class="circle-bullet">
                                    <li>Do not aggravate them.</li>
                                    <li>Do not get into political or ideological discussions. Listen, but don&#8217;t debate.</li>
                                    <li>Try to limit conversation to topics like sports, family, clothing</li>
                                    <li>Comply with instructions, but always maintain your dignity. Obedience to orders or commands need not be swift, cheerful, or overtly enthusiastic, but it should be sufficient to maintain a balanced relationship between the hostages and their captors.</li>
                                    <li>Talk in a normal voice. Avoid whispering when talking to other hostages or raising your voice when taking to a terrorist.</li>
                                    <li>Attempt to develop a positive relationship with them. Identify those captors with whom you can communicate and attempt to establish a relationship with one or more of them. Try to be seen as an empathetic person, not a symbol of their hatreds.</li>
                                    <li>Be proud of your heritage, government, and military association, but use discretion and don&#8217;t be offensive.</li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <p><strong>Keep Occupied</strong></p>
                                  <ul class="circle-bullet">

                              </li>Eat what is offered to you. You must maintain your strength.</li>
                            </li>Establish a slow, methodical routine for every task.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <p><strong>Being Interrogated</strong></p>
                          <ul class="circle-bullet">
                            <li>If you need to avoid answering questions to protect sensitive information, take a simple, tenable position you will be able to remember and maintain.</li>
                            <li>Be polite and keep your temper.</li>
                            <li>Give short answers. Talk freely about nonessential matters, but be guarded when conversations turn to matters of substance.</li>
                            <li>Do not be lulled by a friendly approach. Remember that one terrorist may play &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; and one &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo;. This is the most common interrogation technique.</li>
                            <li>Briefly, affirm your belief in basic democratic principles.</li>
                            <li>Avoid emotionally charged topics of religion, economics, and politics.</li>
                            <li>If forced to present terrorist demands to authorities, in writing or on tape, state clearly that the demands are from your captors.</li>
                            <li>Maintain dignity and avoid making a plea on your behalf.</li>
                          </ul>

                                <i>A Self-Help Guide to ANTITERRORISM, CJCS Guide 5260, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Section II, Guidance for Isolated Personnel, 10 June 2013.</i>

                              <li><strong>Policy</strong></li>
                                <p>Preserving the lives and well-being of U.S. military, DoD civilians, and DoD contractor personnel authorized to accompany the U.S. Armed Forces who are in danger of becoming, or already are, beleaguered, besieged, captured, detained, interned, or otherwise missing or evading capture (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;isolated&rdquo;) while participating in U.S.-sponsored activities or missions, is one of the highest priorities of the Department of Defense.</p> 

                                  <p>The United States Government and its allies will use every appropriate resource to gain the safe return of isolated personnel, those detained by foreign governments, or taken hostage by insurgents, criminal gangs, or terrorist groups. It is U.S. government policy to deny hostage-takers the benefits of ransom, prisoner releases, policy changes, or other acts of concession. However, the U.S. government and allied governments may enter into a dialogue with representatives of those holding hostages in order to endure the safe return of all isolated personnel.</p>

                              <li><strong>Scope</strong></li>
                              <p>Military personnel should follow guidance from the Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is a moral guide designed to assist military personnel in combat or being held as prisoners of war to live up to the ideals contained in the DoD policy. DoD civilians, DoD contractors (under the terms of the contract), family members, and other designated personnel should know their personal legal status under the Geneva Conventions. Knowledge of their personal legal status shall assist those who become captured or isolated to apply properly the rights and privileges afforded to them under international law. More information concerning individual legal status can be gained from the command legal advisor or ATO.</p>
                                <ol>
                                  <li><strong><ins>Conduct of Isolated Personnel</ins></strong></li>
                                  <p>Personnel should consistently conduct themselves in a manner that avoids discrediting themselves and their country and have faith in themselves, their comrades, and country. Isolated personnel should be proactive and maintain a positive attitude that recovery forces are doing everything they can to locate and recover them.</p>

                                  <p>Personnel should do everything possible to return to friendly control, assist other Americans and their allies with whom they are isolated, and do nothing that may harm a fellow American or ally. They should resist, to the utmost of their ability, captor exploitation and protect classified and sensitive information at all times. They should not accept special treatment from a captor, unless such treatment is unconditional. Attempt to extend any unconditional treatment to all Americans and allies in the same situation. To their best ability, personnel should make no written, oral or videotaped statements harmful to the U.S. or its allies.</p>
                                </ol>
                            
                              <li><strong>Rationale</strong></li>
                              <p>Because of their wide range of foreign travel, DoD personnel participate in activities that can result in detention or captivity state and non-state actors. The guidance in this section seeks to help DoD personnel survive these situations with honor and does not constitute a means for judgment or replace the UCMJ or other applicable law as a vehicle for enforcement of proper conduct. This guidance, although exactly the same as the Code of Conduct in some areas, applies only during operations or situations not related specifically in the Code, such as terrorist captivity.</p>

                              <li><strong>General</strong></li>
                              <p>DoD personnel (and their family members) captured by terrorists or detained by hostile foreign governments are often held for individual exploitation, to influence to U.S. government, or both. This exploitation can take many forms, but each form of exploitation is designed to assist the foreign government or the terrorist captors. In the past, terrorists or governments exploited detainees for information and propaganda efforts, including confessions to crimes never committed.</p> 

                                <p>Tis assisted or lent credibility to the detainer. Governments also have been exploited in such a situation to make damaging statements about themselves or to force them to appear weal in relation to other governments. Governments have paid ransoms for captives of terrorists and such payments have improved terrorist finances, supplies, status, and operations, often prolonging the terror carried on by such groups. The U.S. government policy is that it will not negotiate with terrorists.</p>
                              
                              <li><strong>Responsibility</strong></li>
                              <p>The U.S. government will make every good-faith effort to obtain the earliest release of DoD personnel (and their family members), whether detainees or hostages.  Faith in one&rsquo;s country and its way of life, faith in fellow detainees or captives, and faith in one&rsquo;s self are critical to surviving with honor and resisting exploration. Resisting exploitation and having faith in these areas are the responsibility of all Americans. On the other hand, the destruction of such faith must be the assumed goal of all captors determined to maximize their gains from a detention or hostage situation.</p>

                              <li><strong>Goal</strong></li>
                              <p>DoD personnel must take every reasonable step to prevent exploitation of themselves and the U.S. government. If the captive cannot prevent exploitation completely, the captive must take every step to limit exploitation as much as possible. Detained DoD personnel often are catalysts for their own release, based on their ability to become unattractive sources of exploitation; e.g., one who resists successfully may expect detainers to lose interest in further exploitation attempts.</p> 

                              <p>Detainees or hostages must make their own judgments as to how their actions will increase their chances of returning home with honor and dignity. Without exception, the military member who may say honestly that he or she has done his or her utmost in a detention or hostage situation to resist exploitation upholds DoD policy, the founding principles of the United States, and the highest traditions of military service.</p>

                              <li><strong>Military Bearing and Courtesy</strong></li>
                              <p>U.S. military personnel will maintain their military bearing, regardless of the type of detention or captivity or harshness of treatment. They should make every effort to remain calm, courteous, and project personal dignity. That is particularly important during the process of capture and the early stages of internment when the captors may be uncertain of their control over the captives. Discourteous, nonmilitary behavior seldom serves the long-term interest of a detainee or hostage and often results in unnecessary punishment that serves no useful purpose. In some situations, such behavior may jeopardize survival and severely complicate efforts to fain release of the detainee or hostage.</p>

                              <li><strong>Classified Information</strong></li>
                              <p>There are no circumstances in which a detainee or hostage should voluntarily give classified information or materials to those unauthorized to receive them. To the utmost of their ability, DoD personnel held as detainees or hostages will protect all classified information. An unauthorized disclosure of classified information, for whatever reason, does not justify further disclosures. Detainees and hostages must resist, to the utmost of their ability, each and every attempt by their captor to obtain such information.</p>



                              <li><strong>Military Chain of Command</strong></li>
                              <p>In group detention, captivity, or hostage situations, military detainees or hostages will organize, to the fullest extent possible, in a military manner under the senior military member present and eligible to command. The importance of such organization cannot be overemphasized. Historically, in both peacetime and wartime, establishment of a military chain of command has been a tremendous source of strength for all captives.</p> 

                                <p>Every effort will be made to establish and sustain communications with other detainees or hostages. Military detainees or hostages will encourage civilians being held with them to participate in the military organization and accept the authority of the senior military member. In some circumstances, such as embassy duty, military members may be under the direction of a senior U.S. civilian official. Notwithstanding such circumstances, the senior military member still is obligated to establish, as an entity, a military organization and to ensure that the guidelines in support of the DoD policy to survive with honor are not compromised.</p>



                              <li><strong>Guidance for Detention by Hostile Governments (Detainee)</strong></li>
                              <p>DoD personnel must be aware that the basic protections available to prisoners of war under the third Geneva Convention (Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War) may not be provided, as these protections apply only during declared war or international armed conflict. Otherwise, combatants will receive only the minimum protections of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. As a result, detained DoD personnel may be subject to the domestic criminal laws of the detaining nation.</p>

                              <p>For example, if a U.S. person kills a civilian to avoid detection by a hostile force, the individual may face prosecution under the laws of the detaining nation. In addition to the Geneva Conventions, there may also be a status of forces agreement or some other binding agreement that provides certain parameters for the duties of the detaining government.</p> 

                                <p>Detainees should attempt to maintain military bearing, if possible, and should avoid aggressive or combative behavior that would violate the criminal or civil laws of the subject country. However, detainees should not forget that they have an inherent right of self-defense. DoD personnel must be prepared to assess the dangers associated with being taken into captivity by local authorities. Their assessment of the dangers should dictate what efforts should be taken and what measure of force may be required to avoid capture, resist apprehension, and resist cooperation once captured.</p>
                              <ul class="circle-dot">
                                <li>
                                  Governments are obligated to notify the detainee&rsquo;s consular officials. As U.S. citizens, detainees should immediately and continually ask to see U.S. Embassy personnel or a representative of an allied or neutral government.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Escape attempts from governmental detention are not recommended, except under unique or life-threatening circumstances. Although escape is considered a last resort, it may become necessary if conditions deteriorate to the point that the risks associated with escape are less than the risks of remaining captive. These risks would include the death of detainees due to treatment by the detainers or the credible threat of death or torture of the detainees by the detainers.</p> 

                                  <p>Because escape from government detention is a crime in most countries, a failed escape attempt may provide the detainer with further justification to prolong detention by adding additional criminal or civil charges. This would be particularly true if detaining government personnel or civilians were wounded or killed during an escape by or because of the detainee. A detainee in this case may be subjected to severe punishment at the hands of the detainer&rsquo;s legal system that may result in bodily harm or even death to the detainee.</p>
                                </li>
                              </ul>


                              <li><strong>Guidance for Captivity by Terrorists (Hostage)</strong></li>
                              <p>Capture by terrorists is generally the least predictable and structured form of captivity. The captor may qualify as an international criminal. Tension levels will be extremely high during the initial seizing of hostages.</p>
                              <p>
                                Terrorists will likely feel most vulnerable at this point. Hostages should reduce this tension level by controlling their emotions, following instructions as far as practicable, and avoiding physical resistance. Sudden movement or action could precipitate a deadly response.</p>
                                <ul class="circle-dot">
                                  <li>
                                    One recommendation is for military personnel to obtain a U.S. tourist passport to assist in blending in with other travelers and to delay the initial identification process in a hostage situation. Surrender the tourist passport if the terrorists demand identification during the initial stage, or delay identification as a U.S. military or official traveler by claiming inability to locate the documents. If directly confronted about the DoD status, lying is not recommended. The initial delay serves only to maximize survival during the initial stage.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    Hostages should leave evidence of their presence whenever and wherever possible. Leaving fingerprints can assist in locating hostages. DNA, in the form of hair strands with root or drops of blood, should also be inconspicuously deposited when feasible.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    Escape from terrorists is risky but may become necessary if conditions deteriorate to the point that the risks associated with escape are less than the risks of remaining captive. These risks would include torture, the death of hostages due to treatment or the credible threat of death.
                                  </li>
