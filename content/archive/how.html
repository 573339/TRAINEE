  <p>This guide is to help you learn what is taught at RTC. It is used throughout your assignment as a recruit. Each “Topic” represents a lesson or lesson series. Use the Table of Contents to locate the lesson topics. Most likely, your Recruit Division Commander (RDC) will tell you what topics to study. Also, see the Daily Schedule in your compartment to learn what classes are scheduled and the topics to study.</p>

  <h5>SIX KINDS OF SHEETS</h5>
  <p>Each topic has an “Outline Sheet”, and may topics include an “Assignment Sheet” as well. Only a few topics include “Information Sheets”, “Job Sheets”, Diagram Sheets”, and “Problem Sheets”. Each sheet used is listed in the Index in the back of this Trainee Guide. The sheets are identified in the lessons by their Topic Number.</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li><ins>Outline Sheets:</ins> Provide an outline of the major teaching points and follow the instructor’s lesson plan. “Outline Sheets” help you to follow the lesson being taught and provide places for you to write notes.</li>
    <li><ins>Assignment Sheets:</ins> Are study guides that help you prepare for Lessons and Laboratory/practical exercises. Complete and study the appropriate “Assignment Sheets” <ins>before</ins> you take an examination.</li>
    <li><ins>Information Sheets:</ins> Provide information from reference materials, technical manuals and books. “Information Sheets” serve as handy references for important topic material.</li>

  </ul>

  <h5>ENABLING OBJECTIVES</h5>
  <p>You will see at least one Enabling Objective (EO) in each topic. Enabling Objectives identify the Knowledge or Skill you are to learn. You should try to understand the Enabling Objective(s) for each lesson topic while studying the topic’s Outline Sheet.</p>

  <h5>STUDY</h5>
  <p>One or more instructors will conduct classroom and laboratory sessions. Some will be taught by your RDC. You are responsible for completing the material in this guide. Read the Table of Contents and the other “Front Matter” in this guide. This will help you become familiar with the organization of the material.</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li><ins>To Review a Topic:</ins> Turn to the topic’s Outline Sheet. Read the Enabling Objective(s) first, and then review the entire Outline Sheet.</li>
    <li><ins>To Study a Topic:</ins> Turn to the topic’s Assignment Sheet. Study the Introduction, then read the Study Assignment including the Bluejacket’s Manual. Finally, write the answers to the Study Questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>TESTS</h5>
  <p>You will take three written “Tests” while at RTC. All material presented is testable. Success on the written tests is dependent upon understanding the objectives, paying attention in class, taking notes and studying the material. In addition to Written Tests, “Performance Tests” are used to determine your skills in swimming, keeping your locker, military dress, military drill and applying concepts learned through the end of training.</p>
  <h5>CRITIQUES</h5>
  <p>At various times during training you will be given the opportunity to provide your feedback on facilities, services, staff and training. Use these opportunities to provide us your input on what we can do to improve the learning experience at RTC.</p>
  <p>Included at the back of this Trainee Guide are Feedback sheets to provide the curriculum staff your input on issues you encounter with the Trainee Guide. Please take the time to document issues and suggestions on how to improve this product. These sheets will be collected following each academic test and will be used to make changes/corrections for sailors following you.</p>
