  <ol type="1">
  <li class="head-1">Introduction</li>
  <li class="head-1">Equal Opportunity Terms</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Equal Opportunity (EO) -- The right of all persons to participate in and benefit from programs and activities for which they are qualified.</li>
    <li><input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="1"> -- An attitude, usually negative, about a group of people that is not based on fact.</li>
    <li>Discrimination -- Action based on one’s prejudice; i.e., behavior that denies a person equal opportunity.</li>
    <li>Sexual Harassment: UNWELCOMED sexual behavior directed toward someone.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>A form of discrimination.</li>
      <li>The behavior involves UNWELCOMED:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Sexual advances.</li>
        <li>Requests for sexual favors.</li>
        <li>Other verbal or physical sexual behavior.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>To be sexual harassment, the behavior must occur in the work environment.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Work environment -- The workplace or a work-connected place. Examples include:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Offices</li>
      <li>Buildings</li>
      <li>Department of Defense installations</li>
      <li>Department of Defense ships, aircraft, or vehicles</li>
      <li>Anywhere -- When engaged I official business</li>
      <li>Command sponsored social, recreational, or sporting events</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Complainant -- Anyone who submits allegations of discrimination or sexual harassment.</li>
    <li>Formal complaint -- allegation of assault or sexual harassment that is submitted in writing through the chain of command.</li>
    <li>Informal complaint -- Allegation of discrimination or sexual harassment that is made either in writing to the offending party of verbally, and is not submitted as a formal complaint.</li>
    <li>Informal Resolution System (IRS) -- A system for resolving equal opportunity complaints at the lowest possible level in the chain of command.</li>
    <li>Stereotype -- an exaggerated belief that goes beyond existing evidence; e.g., believing that all politicians are crooks.</li>
    <li>Reasonable person standard -- A test used to determine if behavior is discrimination or sexual harassment.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>The test requires that a person take a reasonable point of view in the same circumstances as the complainant.</li>
      <li>When using this standard, if the behavior is offensive, it is considered discrimination or sexual harassment.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Reprisal -- Taking or threatening unfavorable actions, or withholding or threatening to withhold favorable actions, in response to a complaint of sexual harassment or discrimination, e.g., unjustified:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Reduction in evaluation marks.</li>
      <li>Increased duty assignments.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Ethnic group -- A group socially set apart by others because of cultural or nationality characteristics; e.g., American, Oriental, Polish.</li>
    <li>Race -- A division of human beings identified by the possession of traits that are inherited from one’s ancestors; e.g., black, Hispanic, White.</li>
  </ol>

  <li class="head-1">Effects of Social Background on Prejudice and Discrimination</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>From birth, we gather information about our world to form our beliefs and attitudes. We learn from many sources:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>School</li>
      <li>Family</li>
      <li>Neighbors/friends</li>
      <li>Community</li>
      <li>Media (for example, books, movies, and TV)</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Anytime you experience favorable or unfavorable feelings about a person not based on actual experience, you are guilty of prejudice. When you act upon these feelings, you are guilty of discrimination.</li>
    <li>Prejudices and discrimination cause individuals to exclude members of another race, color, religion, gender, age, national origin, ethnic background, or sexual orientation from:</li>
        <ol type="1">
      <li>Employment</li>
      <li>Housing</li>
      <li>Political rights</li>
      <li>Educational opportunities</li>
      <li>Social interaction</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Prejudicial views can manifest into violent actions.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>For instance, a perception of homosexuality does not give an individual the right to act in a harassing or violent manner. Awareness of how prejudice can lead to harmful behavior helps us to prevent its occurrence.</li>
      <li>In October 1992, a Navy airman was beaten to death by two of his shipmates in a public restroom in Sasebo, Japan, due to rumors that he was a homosexual.</li>
      <li>Awareness of how prejudice can lead to harmful behavior helps prevent its occurrence.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Responses to discrimination and violence may cause a “chip on the shoulder” attitude. Victims of discrimination can respond in one of two ways:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Positively, for example:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Participate in peaceful demonstrations.</li>
        <li>Study civil rights issues.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Negatively, for example:</li>
       <ol type="a">
        <li>Acting <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="2"> against one’s own group.</li>
        <li>Withdrawing from family and friends.</li>
        <li>Joining extremist behavior groups.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <li class="head-1">Extremist Behavior Groups</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Gangs -- A group of persons organized for a common purpose, which often involves violation of the law.</li>
    <li>Supremacist groups -- Organizations whose members believe they are superior to others by virtue of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. A few of the most established groups include:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Ku Klux Klan (KKK)</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>White supremacist group</li>
        <li>Anti-black and Semitic</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Neo-Nazis</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>White supremacist group</li>
        <li>Anti-black and Semitic</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Skin Heads</li>
       <ol type="a">
        <li>American Neo-Nazi group</li>
        <li>White supremacist group</li>
        <li>Anti-foreigners, Jews, and racial minorities</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Muslim supremacist group</li>
        <li>The aim of ISIS is to create an Islamic state across the Sunni areas of Iraq and Syria.</li>
        <li>Known for carrying out public executions to further their cause.</li>
        <li>Declared they will destroy westerners.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <li class="head-1">Navy Policy on Participating in Extremist and Discriminatory Activities</li>
  <ol type="a">

        <li>Good order and discipline</li>
        <li>Mission accomplishment</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>There will always be individuals with conflicting outside interests who would rather act secretly than conform to the Service’s expectations. Their activities can have a devastating effect on the good order and conduct essential to the military. Such behaviors can result in disciplinary action or even discharge.</li>
    <li>Commanders have the authority to take disciplinary action, such as recommending separation from the Navy, against personnel who discriminate based on racism, sexual preference, etc.</li>
    <li>Strict military standards are necessary to ensure a command climate that fosters respect for all individuals.</li>
  </ol>

    </ol>
  </ol>

  <li class="head-1">Relationship between the Navy Core Values and Equal Opportunity</li>
  <ol type="1">
    <li><strong>Honor -- </strong>All persons must be accountable for their behavior by treating others with respect and dignity. Everyone must be given the same chance to succeed.</li>
    <li><strong>Courage -- </strong>Everyone must have the courage to report equal opportunity violations, even when faced with opposition from others.</li>
    <li><strong>Commitement -- </strong>All persons must be committed to uphold Navy equal opportunity policies.</li>
    <li>Formal complaint</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The <ins>Navy Equal Opportunity (EO) / Sexual Harassment (SH) Formal Complaint Form</ins> NAVPERS 5354/2 is the primary method to report an EO (discrimination or sexual harassment) formal complaint.</li>
      <li>If the grievance is against a superior other than the Commanding Officer, submit the formal complaint to the Commanding Officer. If the complainant considers the resolution unjust, a complaint can be submitted against the commanding officer.</li>

      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Navy personnel will NOT knowingly make false accusations of sexual harassment. Persons reporting unfounded incidents will be punished.</li>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>Was required to forfeit ½ month’s pay ($596.00).</li>
        <li>Lost their nuclear clearance eligibility and was reclassified.</li>
        <li>Received an entry in their service record to document the misconduct.</li>

      <li>Senior enlisted - junior enlisted; e.g. Chief petty officer - E-6 and below.</li>
      <li>Instructor - student</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Fraternization is gender-neutral. The key element is inappropriate relationships between seniors and subordinates.</li>
    <li>Fraternization is:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Detrimental to good order and discipline.</li>
      <li>In violation of long-standing orders.</li>
      <li>Prohibited.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Fraternization could result in:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>The questioning of a senior’s objectivity.</li>
      <li>Actual or perceived special treatment.</li>
      <li>Undermining the authority of a senior.</li>
