			<strong>Reference<br>
			</strong><em>A Self-Help Guide to ANTITERRORISM, </em>CJCS Guide 5260, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Section II, Guidance for Isolated Personnel, 10 June 2013.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Policy</strong><br>
			Preserving the lives and well-being of U.S. military, DoD civilians, and DoD contractor personnel authorized to accompany the U.S. Armed Forces who are in danger of becoming, or already are, beleaguered, besieged, captured, detained, interned, or otherwise missing or evading capture (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;isolated&rdquo;) while participating in U.S.-sponsored activities or missions, is one of the highest priorities of the Department of Defense. The United States Government and its allies will use every appropriate resource to gain the safe return of isolated personnel, those detained by foreign governments, or taken hostage by insurgents, criminal gangs, or terrorist groups. It is U.S. government policy to deny hostage-takers the benefits of ransom, prisoner releases, policy changes, or other acts of concession. However, the U.S. government and allied governments may enter into a dialogue with representatives of those holding hostages in order to endure the safe return of all isolated personnel.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Scope</strong><br>
			Military personnel should follow guidance from the Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is a moral guide designed to assist military personnel in combat or being held as prisoners of war to live up to the ideals contained in the DoD policy. DoD civilians, DoD contractors (under the terms of the contract), family members, and other designated personnel should know their personal legal status under the Geneva Conventions. Knowledge of their personal legal status shall assist those who become captured or isolated to apply properly the rights and privileges afforded to them under international law. More information concerning individual legal status can be gained from the command legal advisor or ATO.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong><u>Conduct of Isolated Personnel</u></strong><br>
					Personnel should consistently conduct themselves in a manner that avoids discrediting themselves and their country and have faith in themselves, their comrades, and country. Isolated personnel should be proactive and maintain a positive attitude that recovery forces are doing everything they can to locate and recover them. Personnel should do everything possible to return to friendly control, assist other Americans and their allies with whom they are isolated, and do nothing that may harm a fellow American or ally. They should resist, to the utmost of their ability, captor exploitation and protect classified and sensitive information at all times. They should not accept special treatment from a captor, unless such treatment is unconditional. Attempt to extend any unconditional treatment to all Americans and allies in the same situation. To their best ability, personnel should make no written, oral or videotaped statements harmful to the U.S. or its allies.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Rationale</strong><br>
			Because of their wide range of foreign travel, DoD personnel participate in activities that can result in detention or captivity state and non-state actors. The guidance in this section seeks to help DoD personnel survive these situations with honor and does not constitute a means for judgment or replace the UCMJ or other applicable law as a vehicle for enforcement of proper conduct. This guidance, although exactly the same as the Code of Conduct in some areas, applies only during operations or situations not related specifically in the Code, such as terrorist captivity.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>General</strong><br>
			DoD personnel (and their family members) captured by terrorists or detained by hostile foreign governments are often held for individual exploitation, to influence to U.S. government, or both. This exploitation can take many forms, but each form of exploitation is designed to assist the foreign government or the terrorist captors. In the past, terrorists or governments exploited detainees for information and propaganda efforts, including confessions to crimes never committed. Tis assisted or lent credibility to the detainer. Governments also have been exploited in such a situation to make damaging statements about themselves or to force them to appear weal in relation to other governments. Governments have paid ransoms for captives of terrorists and such payments have improved terrorist finances, supplies, status, and operations, often prolonging the terror carried on by such groups. The U.S. government policy is that it will not negotiate with terrorists.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Responsibility</strong><br>
			The U.S. government will make every good-faith effort to obtain the earliest release of DoD personnel (and their family members), whether detainees or hostages.Â  Faith in one&rsquo;s country and its way of life, faith in fellow detainees or captives, and faith in one&rsquo;s self are critical to surviving with honor and resisting exploration. Resisting exploitation and having faith in these areas are the responsibility of all Americans. On the other hand, the destruction of such faith must be the assumed goal of all captors determined to maximize their gains from a detention or hostage situation.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Goal</strong><br>
			DoD personnel must take every reasonable step to prevent exploitation of themselves and the U.S. government. If the captive cannot prevent exploitation completely, the captive must take every step to limit exploitation as much as possible. Detained DoD personnel often are catalysts for their own release, based on their ability to become unattractive sources of exploitation; e.g., one who resists successfully may expect detainers to lose interest in further exploitation attempts. Detainees or hostages must make their own judgments as to how their actions will increase their chances of returning home with honor and dignity. Without exception, the military member who may say honestly that he or she has done his or her utmost in a detention or hostage situation to resist exploitation upholds DoD policy, the founding principles of the United States, and the highest traditions of military service.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Military Bearing and Courtesy</strong><br>
			U.S. military personnel will maintain their military bearing, regardless of the type of detention or captivity or harshness of treatment. They should make every effort to remain calm, courteous, and project personal dignity. That is particularly important during the process of capture and the early stages of internment when the captors may be uncertain of their control over the captives. Discourteous, nonmilitary behavior seldom serves the long-term interest of a detainee or hostage and often results in unnecessary punishment that serves no useful purpose. In some situations, such behavior may jeopardize survival and severely complicate efforts to fain release of the detainee or hostage.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Classified Information</strong><br>
			There are no circumstances in which a detainee or hostage should voluntarily give classified information or materials to those unauthorized to receive them. To the utmost of their ability, DoD personnel held as detainees or hostages will protect all classified information. An unauthorized disclosure of classified information, for whatever reason, does not justify further disclosures. Detainees and hostages must resist, to the utmost of their ability, each and every attempt by their captor to obtain such information.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Military Chain of Command</strong><br>
			In group detention, captivity, or hostage situations, military detainees or hostages will organize, to the fullest extent possible, in a military manner under the senior military member present and eligible to command. The importance of such organization cannot be overemphasized. Historically, in both peacetime and wartime, establishment of a military chain of command has been a tremendous source of strength for all captives. Every effort will be made to establish and sustain communications with other detainees or hostages. Military detainees or hostages will encourage civilians being held with them to participate in the military organization and accept the authority of the senior military member. In some circumstances, such as embassy duty, military members may be under the direction of a senior U.S. civilian official. Notwithstanding such circumstances, the senior military member still is obligated to establish, as an entity, a military organization and to ensure that the guidelines in support of the DoD policy to survive with honor are not compromised.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Guidance for Detention by Hostile Governments (Detainee)</strong><br>
			DoD personnel must be aware that the basic protections available to prisoners of war under the third Geneva Convention (Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War) may not be provided, as these protections apply only during declared war or international armed conflict. Otherwise, combatants will receive only the minimum protections of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. As a result, detained DoD personnel may be subject to the domestic criminal laws of the detaining nation. For example, if a U.S. person kills a civilian to avoid detection by a hostile force, the individual may face prosecution under the laws of the detaining nation. In addition to the Geneva Conventions, there may also be a status of forces agreement or some other binding agreement that provides certain parameters for the duties of the detaining government. Detainees should attempt to maintain military bearing, if possible, and should avoid aggressive or combative behavior that would violate the criminal or civil laws of the subject country. However, detainees should not forget that they have an inherent right of self-defense. DoD personnel must be prepared to assess the dangers associated with being taken into captivity by local authorities. Their assessment of the dangers should dictate what efforts should be taken and what measure of force may be required to avoid capture, resist apprehension, and resist cooperation once captured.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Governments are obligated to notify the detainee&rsquo;s consular officials. As U.S. citizens, detainees should immediately and continually ask to see U.S. Embassy personnel or a representative of an allied or neutral government.
				</li>
				<li>
					Escape attempts from governmental detention are not recommended, except under unique or life-threatening circumstances. Although escape is considered a last resort, it may become necessary if conditions deteriorate to the point that the risks associated with escape are less than the risks of remaining captive. These risks would include the death of detainees due to treatment by the detainers or the credible threat of death or torture of the detainees by the detainers. Because escape from government detention is a crime in most countries, a failed escape attempt may provide the detainer with further justification to prolong detention by adding additional criminal or civil charges. This would be particularly true if detaining government personnel or civilians were wounded or killed during an escape by or because of the detainee. A detainee in this case may be subjected to severe punishment at the hands of the detainer&rsquo;s legal system that may result in bodily harm or even death to the detainee.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Guidance for Captivity by Terrorists (Hostage)</strong><br>
			Capture by terrorists is generally the least predictable and structured form of captivity. The captor may qualify as an international criminal. Tension levels will be extremely high during the initial seizing of hostages. <br>
			<br>
			Terrorists will likely feel most vulnerable at this point. Hostages should reduce this tension level by controlling their emotions, following instructions as far as practicable, and avoiding physical resistance. Sudden movement or action could precipitate a deadly response.
			<ul>
				<li>
					One recommendation is for military personnel to obtain a U.S. tourist passport to assist in blending in with other travelers and to delay the initial identification process in a hostage situation. Surrender the tourist passport if the terrorists demand identification during the initial stage, or delay identification as a U.S. military or official traveler by claiming inability to locate the documents. If directly confronted about the DoD status, lying is not recommended. The initial delay serves only to maximize survival during the initial stage.
				</li>
				<li>
					Hostages should leave evidence of their presence whenever and wherever possible. Leaving fingerprints can assist in locating hostages. DNA, in the form of hair strands with root or drops of blood, should also be inconspicuously deposited when feasible.
				</li>
				<li>
					Escape from terrorists is risky but may become necessary if conditions deteriorate to the point that the risks associated with escape are less than the risks of remaining captive. These risks would include torture, the death of hostages due to treatment or the credible threat of death.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

			<strong>Personal Data</strong><br>
			<p>Law enforcement agencies need timely and accurate information in the event of an emergency. Military personnel, DoD civilians and contractors are required to fill out DD Form 1833, Isolated Personnel Report, before deploying. While much of the same material requested below appears on the DD Form 1833, it is a classified document when completed and will not be available to local law enforcement or other non-DoD agencies.</p>
