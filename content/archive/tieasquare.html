    <h2>A. INTRODUCTION </h2>

    <p>Except among seamen, the word knot is ordinarily used as an all-inclusive term. Even seaman find it hard to clearly define the terms knot, bend and hitch. We will be tying a square knot, bowline and clove hitch. </p>

    <p>Knots are used to form eyes or to secure a cord or line around an object, such as a package. In other words, the line is bent around itself.</p>

    <p>Hitches are used to bend a line to or around an object, such as a ring, spar, bollard or stanchion.</p>

    <h2>E.  JOB STEPS </h2>
    Distribute one piece of small stuff to each student and have student refer to the Knot Tying Wall Chart mounted in the classroom.

    <h4>SQUARE KNOT</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Demonstrate the “Left over Right,” “Right over Left,” method while having recruits follow each step.  Inspect all knots for correctness.</li>
      <li>Display slide “Square Knot” and let it continue to play as recruits’ practice tying the Square Knot a few times.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>BOWLINE</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Display slide “Tying a Bowline” (Story of the Nervous Rabbit)</li>
      <li>Demonstrate how to tie a bowline by using “rabbit, hole and tree” method.  Have recruits use their chair to tie the bowline and follow each step.  Inspect all knots for correctness.</li>
      <li>Display slide “Bowline” and let it continue to play as recruits’ practice tying the Bowline a few times.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>CLOVE HITCH</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Explain the terms “Bitter End” and “Standing End.”  Show slide “Bitter and Standing Ends.”</li>
      <li>Demonstrate how to tie a clove hitch.  Have recruits use their chair to tie the clove hitch as they follow along.  Inspect all knots for correctness.
        <ol>
          <li>Take a turn with the bitter end.</li>
          <li>Pass the end across the standing part.</li>
          <li>Take another turn. (notice both turns go around in the same direction)</li>
          <li>Pass the end under itself, and the hitch is complete.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Display slide “Clove Hitch” and let it continue to play as recruits’ practice tying the Clove Hitch a few times.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>BOWLINE ON A BIGHT</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a bight anywhere in the line ensuring it is large enough to tie the bowline.</li>
      <li>Using the bight as the running part, make a double strand overhand loop. (Same as the bowline)</li>
      <li>Take the double running part under the double overhand loop.  (rabbit hole)</li>
      <li>Take the double running part through the “hole” of the overhand loop.</li>
      <li>Spread the eye of the running part (bight), pulling the bight through the overhead loop and pass it over the double strand bight. </li>
      <li>When the eye of the running part (bight) is around the standing part, grasp the double loop bight and the standing part.  Pull the knot tight.</li>
      <li>Let the recruits’ practice tying the Bowline on a Bight a few times.</li>
    </ol>
