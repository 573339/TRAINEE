  <em>by Francis Scott Key 1814</em>
  <p>Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light<br> What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?<br> Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,<br> O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?<br> And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br> Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.<br> Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br> O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</p>

  <em>Lyrics by George D. Lottman and Domenico Savino</em>
  <p>Stand Navy out to sea,<br> Fight our battle cry;<br> We’ll never change our course,<br> So vicious foe steer shy, y, y, y;<br> Roll out the T.N.T.;<br> Anchors aweigh;<br> Sail on to victory,<br> and sink their bones to Davy Jones hooray!<br><br> Anchors aweigh, my boys, anchors aweigh.<br> Farewell to foreign shores.<br> We sail at break of day, day, day, day.<br> Through our last night ashore.<br> Drink to the foam.<br> Until we meet once more.<br> Here’s wishing you a happy voyage home.<br><br> Ooh, rah, ___ (Division #)<br>Go Navy!<br>Smooth Sailing!</p>
