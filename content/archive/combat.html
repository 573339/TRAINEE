<li>When possible, do not display decals with military or unit affiliations on your vehicle.</li>
<li>Do not openly display military equipment or field gear in your vehicle.</li>
<li>Maintain your automobile:
  <ul>
<li>Keep vehicle in good repair; use trusted mechanics.</li>
<li>Always keep tank at least half full.</li>
<li>Ensure tires have sufficient tread.</li>
<li>Avoid leaving keys with repair shops.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Vehicle Security</strong>
<p>Vehicle Inspection Tips:  Every time you use your automobile, you should conduct a precautionary inspection. Make a habit of checking the vehicle and the surrounding area before entering and starting the vehicle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before entering your vehicle, check the exterior for fingerprints, smudges, scratches or other signs of tampering. Ensure wheel log nuts are tight. Examine tires for stress marks and any evidence of tampering.</li>
<li>Check electronic tampering device (alarm system) if installed. An inexpensive option is to place transparent tape on the doors, hood and trunk of your vehicle to alert you to tampering.</li>
<li>Always look inside the vehicle before you move inside. Check the interior of the vehicle for things out of place. Look for suspicious or unfamiliar items.</li>
<li>Consider the following steps to prevent potential vehicle tampering.
  <ul>
<li>Always secure the doors and windows of your vehicle.</li>
<li>Let a fine coat of dust remain on the vehicle surface to help detect tampering.</li>
<li>Ensure the hood of your vehicle had a release latch located inside the vehicle.</li>
<li>Use a locking fuel cap.</li>
<li>Install two bolts (perpendicular to each other) through the exhaust pipe. This prevents the insertion of explosives in the tail pipe.</li>
<li>Install an intrusion alarm.</li>
<li>Only use steel-belted radial tires for your vehicle. You may also consider the use of &ldquo;run-flat&rdquo; tires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you find something out of the ordinary, DO NOT TOUCH IT. Contact the local authorities to report your findings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On The Road</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Before leaving buildings to get into your vehicle, check the surrounding area to determine if anything of suspicious nature exists. Display the same wariness before exiting your vehicle.</li>
<li>Prior to getting into a vehicle, check beneath it for any tampering or bombs by looking for wires, tape or anything unusual.</li>

<li>Stay away from controversial meeting places; visit only reputable establishments, but do not frequent the same off base location (in particular, unknown, U.S. associated locales).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>TIPS FOR DEFENSIVE AIR TRAVEL</strong>

<p>Air travel, particularly through high-risk airports or countries, poses security problems different from those of ground transportation. Simple precautions can reduce your vulnerability to a terrorist assault.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Making Travel Arrangements</strong>
<ul>
<li>Get an area of responsibility (AOR)-specific threat briefing from your security officer, anti-terrorism officer (ATO), or the appropriate counterintelligence or security organization prior to traveling. This briefing is mandatory prior to overseas travel and must occur within three months prior to travel. It should also include any AOR-specific AT requirements as directed by the geographic combatant commander. Most geographic combatant commanders put useful information on their Internet sites. Your force protection officer will know which areas DoD considers a high-risk area.</li>
<li>Before traveling, consult the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide to ensure you know and meet all requirements for travel to a particular country.</li>
<li>Use military air or U.S. flag carriers.</li>
<li>Avoid scheduling through high-risk areas; if necessary, use foreign flag airlines and/or indirect routing to avoid high-risk airports.</li>
<li>Do not use rank or military address on tickets, travel documents, or hotel reservations.</li>
<li>Select window seat; they offer more protection since aisle seats are closer to the hijackers&#8217; movements up and down the aisle.</li>
<li>Mid-cabin seats offer more protection since they are farther from hostile action near the cockpit and at the rear of the cabin.</li>
<li>Seats at an emergency exit may provide an opportunity to escape.</li>
<li>Avoid off-base hotels. If available, use government quarters or contracted hotels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Personal Identification</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Do not discuss your military affiliation, job titles, or responsibilities with strangers.</li>
<li>You must have proper identification to show airline and immigration officials.</li>
<li>Consider using a tourist passport if you have one with the necessary visas, provided the country you are visiting allows it.</li>
<li>If you use a tourist passport, consider placing your official passport, military ID, travel orders, and related documents in your checked luggage, not in your wallet or briefcase.</li>
<li>If you carry your official passport, military ID, travel orders, and related documents, select a hiding place onboard the aircraft to &ldquo;ditch&rdquo; them in case of a hijacking. (The inner part of the window may be a quick and effective place.)</li>
<li>Do not carry classified documents unless they are absolutely mission essential. E-mail documents ahead whenever possible or use alternate shipment means.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Luggage</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Use plain, civilian luggage; avoid military-looking bags, B-4 bags, duffel bags, etc.</li>
<li>Remove all military patches, logos or decals from your luggage and briefcase.</li>
<li>Ensure luggage tags do not show your rank or military address.</li>
<li>Do not carry official papers in your briefcase. If official papers must be carried, place them in a sealed, non-descript folder in your briefcase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clothing</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Travel in conservative civilian clothing when using commercial transportation or military airlift if you are to connect with a flight at a commercial terminal in a high-risk area. Some geographic combatant commanders, including U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), have imposed restrictions on the wearing of military uniforms aboard commercial aircraft or vessels within their respective AOR. Check requirements before traveling.</li>
<li>Do not wear distinct military items such as organizational shirts, caps or military issue shoes or glasses.</li>
<li>Do not wear U.S. identified items such as cowboy hats or boots, baseball caps, American logo T-shirts, jackets or sweatshirts.</li>
<li>Wear a long-sleeved shirt if you have visible U.S.-affiliated tattoos.</li>
<li>Do not get a fresh, close military haircut before going on international trips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Precautions At The Airport</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Arrive early and watch for suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Look for nervous passengers who maintain eye contact with others from a distance.</li>
<li>Observe what people are carrying. Note behavior not consistent with that of others in the area.</li>
<li>No matter where you are in the terminal, identify objects suitable for cover in the event of attack. Pillars, trash cans, luggage, large planters, counters, and furniture can provide protection.</li>
<li>Do not linger near open public areas. Proceed through security checkpoints as soon as possible in order to be in a more secure area.</li>
<li>Avoid secluded areas that provide concealment for attackers.</li>
<li>Be aware of unattended baggage anywhere in the terminal.</li>
<li>Be extremely observant of personal carry-on luggage. Thefts of briefcases designed for laptop computers are increasing at airports worldwide. Likewise, luggage not properly guarded provides an opportunity for a terrorist to place an unwanted object or device in your carry-on bag. As much as possible, do not pack anything you cannot afford to lose; if the documents are important, make a copy and carry the copy.</li>
<li>Observe the baggage claim area from a distance and claim your luggage at first opportunity, without force you way through large crowds. Precede to the customs lines at the edge of the crowd.</li>
<li>Report suspicious activity to the airport security personnel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Actions If Attacked In An Airport</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Dive for cover. Do not run. Running increases the probability of shrapnel hitting vital organs, or the head.</li>
<li>If you must move, crawl, and stay low to the ground, using available cover. If the threat is from weapons fire, avoid lying on floors or standing along walls as ricocheting bullets and projectiles tend to &ldquo;hug&rdquo; floors and walls.</li>
<li>If you see grenades, seek immediate cover; lay flat on the floor, feet and knees tightly together, with soles toward the grenade. In this position, your shoes, feet and legs protect the rest of your body. Shrapnel will rise in a cone from the point of detonation, passing over your body.</li>
<li>Place arms and elbows next to your ribcage to protect your lungs, heart, and chest. Cover your ears and head with your hands to protect neck, and chest. Cover your ears and head with your hands to protect neck, arteries, ears, and skull.</li>
<li>Responding security personnel will not be able to distinguish you from attackers. Do not attempt to assist them in any way. Lie still until told to get up.
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Actions If Hijacked</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Determining the best response in a hostage situation is a critical judgment call. Passengers need to remain extremely alert and rational to try to understand the intentions of the hijackers. Sitting quietly may be prudent in most circumstances, but it is conceivable the situation may require actions to not allow hijackers to take control of the aircraft. In all situations, it is important for individuals to remain alert to unexpected events, think clearly, and act responsibly.</li>
<li>Remain calm; be polite and cooperate with your captors.</li>
<li>Be aware that all hijackers may not reveal themselves at the same time. A lone hijacker may be used to draw out security personnel for neutralization by other hijackers.</li>
<li>Surrender your tourist passport in response to a general demand for identification.</li>
<li>Do not offer any information; confirm your military status only if directly confronted with the fact. Be prepared to explain that you always travel on your personal passport that no deceit was intended.</li>
<li>Discreetly dispose of any military or U.S.-affiliated documents.</li>
<li>Do not draw attention to yourself with sudden body movements, verbal remarks, or hostile looks.</li>
<li>Prepare yourself for possible verbal and physical abuse and deprivation of food, drink, and sanitary conditions.</li>
<li>If permitted, read, sleep, or write to occupy your time.</li>
<li>Discreetly observe your captors and memorize their physical descriptions. Include voice patterns and language distinctions, as well as clothing and unique physical characteristics. Observe how they are armed.</li>
<li>If possible, observe if the pilots remain in control of the aircraft.</li>
<li>Be aware that there could be federal authorities, such as Air Marshals, on the aircraft who may better suited to take action.</li>
<li>If an Air Marshal or flight attendant requests your assistance while taking action, help them as best you can.</li>
<li>During rescue attempts, stay low in a seated, or &ldquo;crash&rdquo; position, until told to rise and cooperate with all instructions from the rescuers.</li>
</ul>

<strong>TIPS FOR ACTIVE SHOOTER RESPONSE</strong>

<p>Active shooters are individuals who attempt to kill people in confined and populated areas, often displaying no pattern in their selection of victims. It is not an uncommon terrorist tactic. Active shooter situations tend to be unpredictable and evolve quickly, often before law enforcement personnel arrive. To increase you and your family’s chance of survival in an active shooter situation, you should familiarize yourself with the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indicators Of A Potential Active Shooter</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Early recognition of a threat can prevent an incident. The following are pre-attack indicators for a potential active shooter: (This list is not all inclusive, nor should it be used to diagnose violent tendencies)
<ul>
<li>Anti-American statements asserting that U.S. policy and authority is illegitimate.</li>
<li>Aggression or threats towards coworkers.</li>
<li>Presence of unauthorized weapons.</li>
<li>Attempts to communicate with U.S. enemies.</li>
<li>Unfounded allegations of U.S. persecution or prejudice against a minority group or religion.</li>
<li>Abnormal mood swings or depression, withdrawn behavior, decrease in hygiene, paranoia (i.e. “everyone is against me”), increased use of alcohol or illegal drugs.</li>
<li>Suicidal remarks or comments about &ldquo;putting things in order.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Repeated violations of policies, regulations, or laws.</li>
<li>Talk of severe financial problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>History indicates that individuals that have become active shooters in a workplace display potentially violent behavior over time. If you recognize these behaviors, inform your supervisor. If you perceive an immediate threat, alert unit security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Evacuate</strong>
  <p>You need to quickly determine the most reasonable way to protect your life, as well as those around you, whenever possible. If you can escape, consider the following:</p>
  <ul>
<li>Have an escape route and plan in mind.</li>
<li>Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow.</li>
<li>Leave your belongings behind.</li>
<li>Help others escape, if possible.</li>
<li>Prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be.</li>
<li>Keep your hands visible.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions of security personnel.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to move wounded people.</li>
<li>Call emergency personnel when you are safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shelter In Place</strong>
  <ul>
<li>If evacuation is not possible, find a place where the active shooter is less likely to find you. The place you choose should:
  <ul>
<li>Be out of the active shooter&#8217;s view.</li>
<li>Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e. an office with a closed and locked door).</li>
<li>Not trap you or restrict your options for movement.</li>
<li>Have furniture to block the door, if possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lock the door, silence your cell phone, hide behind large items, remain quiet and calm, and call emergency personnel. If you are not able to speak, leave the line open to allow the dispatcher to listen.</li>
<li>If you get attacked, you can adapt your response to the type of weapon being used by an attacker:
  <ul>
<li>Ricocheting bullets tend to hug the floor; crouching (not lying) on the floor may reduce exposure.</li>
<li>Grenade shrapnel rises from the detonation location; lying on the floor reduces exposure and having feet toward the blast may protect your head.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<li><strong>Take Action Against The Active Shooter</strong>
  <ul>
<li>As a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent danger, try to disrupt or incapacitate the shooter by:
  <ul>
<li>Acting aggressively against him or her.
<li>Throwing items and improvising weapons.
<li>Yelling.
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taking action against the active shooter is extremely risky, but may be the best chance of survival for you and others. If you decide to assume the risk, you must remain committed to your actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cooperate With first Responders</strong>
  <ul>
<li>When first responders arrive, support their efforts and do not be a distraction:
  <ul>
<li>Remain calm and follow instructions.</li>
<li>Put down any items in your hands.</li>
<li>Raise hands and spread your finders.</li>
<li>Avoid quick movements.</li>
<li>Do not cling to emergency personnel.</li>
<li>Avoid pointing, screaming, or yelling.</li>
<li>Do not stop to ask first responders for help or direction when evacuating.</li>
<li>Evacuate in the direction first responders are entering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>First responders will need the following information:
  <ul>
<li>Location of the active shooter.</li>
<li>Number of shooters.</li>
<li>Physical description of shooter(s).</li>
<li>Number and type of weapons held by the shooter(s).</li>
<li>Number of potential victims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>HOTEL SECURITY</strong>
<ul>
<strong>Hotels present special security challenges since they are restrictive areas and unfamiliar.</strong>
<li><strong>Hotel Selection</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Stay in military or government temporary lodging if available.</li>
<li>Chose a hotel for safety. Obtain a recommendation from the US Embassy or unit security officer.</li>
<li>Consider the surrounding neighborhood, proximity to police, and reputation for good administration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Room Selection</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Choose a room between 3rd & 7th floor; high enough to discourage outside break-ins but within reach of fire ladder equipment in emergency.</li>
<li>Request a different room upon check-in; this may protect you from someone who managed to get your room number from a reservation.</li>
<li>Change rooms every few days to be more unpredictable if you suspect you are at risk.</li>
<li>Choose a room that opens to the hotel interior; threat activities are deterred by the observation of hotel staff. Exterior entrances may be less protected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Activities In The Hotel</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Minimize your public exposure and recogizability. Blend in.</li>
<li>Do not accept unexpected deliveries and visitors. Call hotel desk to confirm identities of hotel employees.</li>
<li>Vary your routines and patterns in the hotel. Conceal your room location by entering when hallway is empty. Get off elevator on wrong floor; change elevators or take stairs.</li>
<li>Pre-plan emergency actions; write down emergency numbers.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t disclose room number or military affiliation to anyone. Maintain control of your room key.</li>
<li>Make your room look occupied when you are out. Keep TV and lights on; up &ldquo;do not disturb&rdquo; sign on door.</li>
<li>Lock valuables in hotel safe; don&#8217;t carry DoD documents.</li>
<li>Inspect room upon reentry for tampering or intruders.</li>
<li>Be sensitive to surveillance; be alert for strangers with undue interest in your purpose and activities. Report suspicious activities to security authorities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surveillance: Terrorists secretly observe potential targets to detect vulnerabilities and plan attacks.</strong>
  <ul>
<li>If terrorists are observing, they are susceptible to being observed. Be alert to surveillance.</li>
<li>With surveillance terrorists seek to identify predictable patterns that can be exploited in an attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Surveillance Methods</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Broad surveillance begins with less trained observers, local recruits, and informants.</li>
<li>When prospective targets are identified, surveillance is intensified and focused, often with more expert operatives.</li>
<li>As planning advances, terrorists may take pictures and perform walk-through rehearsal of actions.</li>
<li>As the date of attack approaches, surveillance may become more secretive and limited, consequently, harder to detect.</li>
<li>Surveillance may be on foot or in vehicles.</li>
<li>A surveillance team is harder to detect.</li>
<li>Surveillance is a critical pre-attack activity and a top priority for security programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Detection of Surveillance</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Be vigilant and constantly scan people and vehicles in your vicinity.</li>
<li>Be familiar with normal surroundings so you can recognize abnormal things.</li>
<li>Examples of undercover surveillance include individuals posing as utility workers, street vendors, people waiting for a bus, or vehicle drive-byes.</li>
<li>Look for familiar faces among strangers and repeated vehicle sightings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Respond To Surveillance</strong>
  <ul>
<li>If you are followed on foot, change your pace or pause to window shop and note if the suspicious individual pauses.</li>
<li>Retrace your steps and look for familiar faces.</li>
<li>An alert demeanor implies you are a harder target and is deterrence to surveillance.</li>
<li>If you suspect you are under surveillance, move directly to a secure location and report details to security personnel.</li>
<li>Report suspicious individuals near your installation, with detailed descriptions, to security personnel so that counter-surveillance efforts may be organized.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<strong>IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES</strong>

<p>Terrorists use improved explosive devices to deceive defensive measures and maximize the effect of terror. Ordinary looking objects are turned into weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspicious Packages or Mail</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Suspicious characteristics to look for include:
  <ul>
<li>Unusual or unknown place of origin.</li>
<li>No return address.</li>
<li>Excessive amount of postage.</li>
<li>Abnormal or unusual size or shape.</li>
<li>Protruding strings, aluminum foil or wires.</li>
<li>Misspelled words.</li>
<li>Differing return address and postmark.</li>
<li>Handwritten labels, foreign handwriting, or poorly typed addresses.</li>
<li>Unusual order. (deliberate or sustained smelling of a piece of mail to determine the existence of an unusual odor is not advised; this could expose you to chemical or biological agents.)</li>
<li>Unusual or unbalanced weight, either heaviness or lightness.</li>
<li>Springiness in the top, bottom or sides.</li>
<li>Inflexibility.</li>
<li>Crease marks, discoloration or oily stains.</li>
<li>Incorrect titles or title with no name.</li>
<li>Excessive security material, such as masking tape, string, etc.</li>
<li>Ticking, beeping or other sounds.</li>
<li>Marked with special instruction(s) such as &ldquo;Personal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rush&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do Not Delay&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Evidence of contamination, such as a powdery substance that is out of place in the package or not normally received from the sender.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The lack of the above indicators does not guarantee the package is safe.  Use your best judgment.</li>
<li>Do not handle suspicious packages unnecessarily. Never cut tape, strings, or other wrappings on a suspect package or immerse a suspected letter or package in water. Such action could cause an explosive device to detonate.</li>
<li>If the object has already been moved, place the letter or package in a plastic bag or some other container to prevent leakage of contents.  If you are not certain whether a package or letter has been moved, avoid touching or moving it.</li>
<li>If handling mail suspected of containing chemical or biological contaminants, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.</li>
<li>Make a list of personnel who were in the room or area when the suspicious envelope or package was recognized.</li>
<li>Report any suspicious mail or packages to security officials immediately.  Isolate the item if possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Imagine the Possibilities</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Bombs can come in many forms: pope bombs, briefcases, suitcases, car trunks, panel trucks, food concession trucks, septic system trucks, fuel trucks, or moving vans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>CHEMICAL THREATS</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Information About Chemical Agents</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Most chemical agents are liquids, often aerosols, and though some effects are delayed, most induce an immediate response.</li>
<li>There are many different chemical agents a terrorist could use as a weapon.</li>
<li>Inhalation is the most likely method of delivery, though food or water contamination is possible.</li>
<li>Protection of the breathing airway is the single most important factor of defense.</li>
<li>Many agents are heavier than air and will stay close to the ground.  Move upward for safety.</li>
<li>Medical attention should be sought immediately, even if exposure is thought to be limited.</li>
<li>Many chemical agents will break down when exposed to sun, diluted with water, or dissipated in high winds.</li>
<li>Evacuation upwind from the area of attack is always advisable, unless you are equipped with a proper breathing device and protective clothing.</li>
<li>If inside a building with contamination outside, remain inside and shelter in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Detection Of Chemical Attack</strong>
  <ul>
<li>A chemical attack or incident may not be immediately apparent. Many agents are odorless and colorless.</li>
<li>Be alert to indicators of such agents:
  <ul>
<li>Droplets of oily film on surfaces.</li>
<li>Dead or dying animals in the area.</li>
<li>Liquid sprays or vapors.</li>
<li>Odors (smell of bitter almonds, peach kernels, newly mowed hay, or green grass).</li>
<li>Unusual or unauthorized spraying in the area.</li>
<li>Low-lying clouds of fog unrelated to weather; clouds of dust; or suspended, possibly colored particles.</li>
<li>Attackers might dress unusually (long-sleeved shirts or overcoats in the summertime) or wearing breathing protection, particularly in areas where large numbers of people tend to congregate, such as subways, or stadiums.</li>
<li>Victims might display symptoms of nausea, difficulty breathing, convulsions, disorientation, or patterns of illness inconsistent with natural disease.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defense In a Chemical Attack</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Protection of breathing airways is key. Unless you have a gas mask, the only sure way to protect an airway is to get away from the source of the agent. While evacuating, cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief, coat sleeve, or any piece of cloth to provide some means of protection.</li>
<li>Stay alert. Early detection enhances survival.</li>
<li>Move upwind from the source of attack.</li>
<li>If evacuation is impossible, move outdoors or to a room on a higher floor. Many agents are heavier than air and will stay close to the ground.</li>
<li>If indoors and no escape is possible, close all windows and exterior doors; shut down air conditioning or heating systems to prevent air circulation.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose. If gas masks are not available, use a surgical mask or handkerchief. Soak a cloth in a solution of a tablespoon of baking soda in one cup of water. Not highly effective, but it gives some protection.</li>
<li>Cover bare arms and legs and bandage any cuts or abrasions.</li>
<li>If splashed with an agent, wipe it off immediately with lots of warm soapy water or a diluted 10:1 bleach solution.</li>
<li>If water is not available, use talcum powder or flour to decontaminate liquid agents. Sprinkle liberally over affected skin areas, wait 30 seconds, gently wipe off with a rag or gauze pad.</li>
<li>Get immediate medical attention, even if the exposure is thought to be limited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>TAKEN HOSTAGE -- YOU CAN SURVIVE!</strong>

<p>If you are taken hostage, remember your personal conduct can influence treatment in captivity. The Department of State has responsibility for the protection of all U.S. Government (USG) personnel and their dependents, other than those personnel under the5 command of a U.S. area military commander. If kidnapped and taken hostage, the hostage has three very important rules to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the problem so as not to aggravate the situation.</li>
<li>Make decisions to keep the situation from worsening.</li>
<li>Maintain discipline to remain on the best terms with the captors.</li>
<li><strong>Preparing The Family</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Have your family affairs in order, including a current will, appropriate powers of attorney, and measures taken to ensure family financial security.</li>
<li>Issues such as continuing the children&#8217;s education, family relocation and disposition of property should be discussed with family members.</li>
<li>Your family should know that talking about your official affiliation to non-DoD people may place you, or them, in great danger. Family members should consult with the local public affairs office prior to talking with media or answering any questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stay In Control</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Recognize the moment when resistance is futile. Your instinct may be to struggle, but you should stop when faced with deadly force.</li>
<li>The moment of attack is the point of maximum danger since your captors are most likely to panic or use excessive force. If they wanted to kill you, they wouldn&#8217;t try to capture you.</li>
<li>Regain your composure as soon as possible and recognize your fear. Your captors are probably as apprehensive as you are, so your actions are important.</li>
<li>Take mental notes of directions, times of transit, noises, and other factors to identify your location.</li>
<li>Note the number, physical description, accents, habits, and rank structure of your captors.</li>
<li>Anticipate isolation and efforts to disorient and confuse you.</li>
<li>To the extent possible, try to mentally prepare yourself for the situation ahead. Stay mentally active.</li>
<li>Attempt to secretly leave fingerprints or DNA material (e.g., hair strand with root, drop of blood) in vehicles or places where you are held.</li>
<li>Your captors must be convinced the US Government will work to obtain your safe release.</li>
<li>Do not be depressed if negotiation efforts appear to be taking a long time. Remember that your chances of survival actually increase with time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dealing With Your Captors</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Do not aggravate them.</li>
<li>Do not get into political or ideological discussions. Listen, but don&#8217;t debate.</li>
<li>Try to limit conversation to topics like sports, family, clothing</li>
<li>Comply with instructions, but always maintain your dignity. Obedience to orders or commands need not be swift, cheerful, or overtly enthusiastic, but it should be sufficient to maintain a balanced relationship between the hostages and their captors.</li>
<li>Talk in a normal voice. Avoid whispering when talking to other hostages or raising your voice when taking to a terrorist.</li>
<li>Attempt to develop a positive relationship with them. Identify those captors with whom you can communicate and attempt to establish a relationship with one or more of them. Try to be seen as an empathetic person, not a symbol of their hatreds.</li>
<li>Be proud of your heritage, government, and military association, but use discretion and don&#8217;t be offensive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Keep Occupied</strong>
  <ul>
</li>Exercise daily.</li>
</li>Read anything and everything.</li>
</li>Eat what is offered to you. You must maintain your strength.</li>
</li>Establish a slow, methodical routine for every task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Being Interrogated</strong>
  <ul>
<li>If you need to avoid answering questions to protect sensitive information, take a simple, tenable position you will be able to remember and maintain.</li>
<li>Be polite and keep your temper.</li>
<li>Give short answers. Talk freely about nonessential matters, but be guarded when conversations turn to matters of substance.</li>
<li>Do not be lulled by a friendly approach. Remember that one terrorist may play &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; and one &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo;. This is the most common interrogation technique.</li>
<li>Briefly, affirm your belief in basic democratic principles.</li>
<li>Avoid emotionally charged topics of religion, economics, and politics.</li>
<li>If forced to present terrorist demands to authorities, in writing or on tape, state clearly that the demands are from your captors.</li>
<li>Maintain dignity and avoid making a plea on your behalf.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>During Rescue</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Drop to the floor and be still. Avoid sudden moves. Wait for instruction.</li>
<li>Once released, avoid derogatory comments about your captors; such remarks will only make things harder for those still held captive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
