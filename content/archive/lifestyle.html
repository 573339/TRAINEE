<ol type="1">
<li class="head-1">Energy Balance Is Key</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Energy in = Food and fluids consumed</li>
<li>Energy out = Calories burned by the body</li>
<li>If you take in more calories than you burn, your body stores the extra as fat and you gain weight.</li>
<li>If you take in fewer calories than you use, your body burns stored calories and you lose weight.</li>
<li>When energy in equals energy out, body weight is stable.</li>
</ol>


<li class="head-1">Energy In – Manage Weight Through Good Food Habits</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Eat a variety of foods every day (Use the ChooseMyPlate.gov).</li>
<li>Vary the colors in your diet by eating at least 5 servings of fruits & vegetables per day.</li>
<li>Eat 3 meals a day to distribute calories for better energy utilization. Do not skip breakfast.</li>
<li>Eat smaller portions of foods.</li>
<li>Reduce high-sugar foods (sodas, candy, desserts, limit fruit juice).</li>
<li>Limit high fat foods (fried, mayonnaise or dairy based sauces or dressings).</li>
<li>Avoid a severe calorie restriction.</li>
<li>Keep a diet journal when attempting to lose weight.</li>
</ol>


<li class="head-1">Energy In – Carbohydrates</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>The body uses carbohydrates for immediate energy.</li>
<li>Carbohydrates (starch/sugars) can comprise up to 50%-65% of calories (5-7 g per kg body weight).</li>
<li>Food sources include bread, cereal, pasta, rice, beans, fruit, and vegetables.</li>
<li>Choose whole grains including whole grain breads, legumes, dried beans, fruits, vegetables.</li>
</ol>


<li class="head-1">Energy In – Protein</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Necessary for rebuilding and repairing body tissue.</li>
<li>Approximately 15% of calories should come from protein (0.8-1.4 g per kg body weight).</li>
<li>Food sources are meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, milk.</li>
<li>Choose lean sources of protein (non-fried, without skin).</li>
<li>Protein is used for energy if fat or carbohydrate is lacking in the diet.</li>
<li>Choose seafood at least twice a week as a main protein food.</li>
</ol>


<li class="head-1">Energy In – Fat</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Fat is needed by the body for organ and nerve tissue.</li>
<li>Fat in the diet carries the vitamins A, D, E, and K to be stored by the liver.</li>
<li>Fat should be about 25-35% of calories, but only 7% of the calories should come from saturated fat or animal fat (butter, bacon, fried food, baked goods).</li>
<li>Fat is calorie dense (9 calories/gram), so portions should be small.</li>
<li>Limit animal sources including cheese, sausages, hot dogs, bacon and butter.</li>
<li>Choose healthy plant fats including olive or canola oil nuts and seeds.</li>
<li>Look for seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, trout, tuna, and herring.</li>
<li>Do not strive for a fat free diet. <ins>Fat is essential. Moderation is the key.</ins></li>
</ol>

<li>Main source is dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese and calcium fortified soymilk). Choose low-fat (1% or less) choices.</li>
<li>You need at least 3 servings daily (1000+ mg).</li>
<li>Calcium is good for maintaining strong bones and teeth. If you don’t get enough, bones can weaken – leading to stress fractures, broken bones, etc.</li>
</ol>


<li class="head-1">Energy In – Water</li>
<ol type="a">

</ol>


<li class="head-1">Energy In – How Do Vitamins Fit In?</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Vitamins and minerals do not provide energy – they can help our bodies get energy from the foods we eat.</li>
<li>Needed to regulate body systems, build/repair tissue, prevent diseases, etc.</li>
<li>Supplements are not warranted if you are eating a balanced diet with plenty of variety.</li>
<li>Do your own research before choosing to take any supplement.</li>
