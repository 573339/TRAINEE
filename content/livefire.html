This rule is intended to prevent unintentional injury to personnel or damage to property from handling or transferring possession of a weapon.</li><li><span class="list-number">(2)</span>Rule 2:  Never point a weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot.  This rule enforces the importance of muzzle awareness and reinforces positive identification of the target.</li><li><span class="list-number">(3)</span>Rule 3:  Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you are ready to fire.  This rule is intended to minimize the risk of firing the weapon negligently</li><li><span class="list-number">(4)</span>Rule 4: Keep weapon on SAFE until you intend to fire.
