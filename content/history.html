   <li class="head-1">Introduction</li>
   <ol type="a">
     <li>13 October 1775 is the day we celebrate as the U.S. Navy&#8217;s birthday.</li>
     <li>Our Navy has earned its reputation through any number of things:</li>
       <ol type="1">
         <li>Great victories,</li>
         <li>Daring and courageous engagements,</li>
         <li>The necessity of war, and</li>
         <li>The actions of its courageous Sailors.</li>
       </ol> 
   </ol>


   <li class="head-1">The Navy&#8217;s Early Years</li>
   <ol type="a">
     <li>General George Washington was the first to realize the need for ships.</li>
     <li>John Adams argued for the formation of a Continental Navy.</li>
     <li>Continental Congress established the Continental Navy on 13 October 1775.</li>
     <li>The schooner <strong>Hannah</strong> became the first ship commissioned in the Continental cause.</li>
     <ol type="1">
      <li>The schooner <strong>Hannah</strong> took the British vessel <strong>Unity</strong> as her first prize.</li>
     </ol>
     <li>In 1894, Congress reluctantly agreed to order the construction of six frigates under the Naval Act of 1794.</li>
     <ol type="1">
     <li>The first of the six frigates launched was the <strong>USS United States</strong>.</li>
       <ol type="a">
         <li>It took over three years to complete.</li>
         <li>Launched in 1797.</li>
         <li>Served the nation for 66 years.</li>
       </ol>
   
     <li>The second frigate completed was the <strong>USS Constellation</strong>.</li>
        <ol type="a">
         <li>Commissioned in 1797.</li>
         <li>First American ship to capture an enemy ship.</li>
         <li>Served for 56 years.</li>
         <li>Oldest American warship.</li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>The <strong>United States</strong> was completed first, <strong>Constellation</strong> was commissioned first.</li>
          </ol>
       </ol>
        
    <li>The third frigate commissioned was the <strong>USS Constitution</strong>.</li>
     <ol type="a">
       <li>The only remaining ship of the original six frigates.</li>
       <li>The oldest commissioned ship in the world.</li>
      <ol type="1">
       <li>During the War of 1812, the <strong>USS Constitution</strong> engaged in an historic battle with the British ship <strong>HMS Guerriere</strong>.</li>
       <li>The two ships fought for two-and-a-half hours.</li>
       <li>Captain Isaac Hull of Constitution maneuvered about, positioning himself to release several broadsides, literally blowing the masts off the <strong>Guerriere</strong>.</li>
       <li>By 6:20 a.m. Captain Dacres of the <strong>Guerriere</strong> recorded that the <strong>Guerriere</strong> had been reduced to a &ldquo;perfect, unmanageable wreck.&rdquo;</li>
       <li>During the engagement, an American Sailor noticed a British cannon ball strike the side of Constitution and fall harmlessly into the sea.</li>
         <ol type="a">
           <li>He was so thrilled by this sight that he yelled &ldquo;Huzzah! Her sides are made of iron!&rdquo;</li>
         </ol>
       <li>From that day, Constitution became known as &ldquo;Old Ironsides.&rdquo;</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  <li>The first naval ship commissioned in the 19th century was the <strong>USS Chesapeake</strong>, the fourth frigate of the original six.</li>
  <ol type="a">
   <li>Commissioned in 1800</li>
   <li>The shortest career of the six.</li>
   <li>Captured by the British on 1 June 1813.</li>
     <ol type="1">
       <li>Although Captain James Lawrence was mortally wounded in the ensuing battle, he encouraged his men by yelling, &ldquo;Don&#8217;t give up the ship!&rdquo;</li>
     </ol>
   </ol>

<li>The <strong>USS Congress</strong> and <strong>USS President</strong></li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li>The final two.</li>
   <li>Both saw combat in the War of 1812.</li>
 </ol>

<li>The six stars on a Navy officer&#8217;s &ldquo;Command at Sea&rdquo; pin represents the original six frigates.</li>
</ol>

<li>They were designed to be powerful and fast, boasting 44 guns each.</li>
<li>A unique cross-bracing system was designed to strengthen the ship&#8217;s skeleton, leading to the legend of &ldquo;Old Ironsides&rdquo;.</li>
<li>With nearly an acre of sail area, they could out-sail any ship they couldn&#8217;t sink.</li>

</ol>




<li class="head-1">Special Noteworthy Ships</li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li><strong>USS Enterprise</strong></li>
     <ol type="1">
       <li>Eight ships have been named Enterprise, with the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise in service today.</li>
       <li>The first <strong>Enterprise</strong></li>
         <ol type="a">
           <li>Captured as the <strong>HMS George</strong> and renamed <strong>Enterprise</strong> by Colonel Benedict Arnold.</li>
             <ol>
               <li>In May of 1775, under the command of the Colonel Benedict Arnold, the Colonial Army captured several British warships at St. Johns, a fort situated on the Richelieu River. One of the prizes captured by Arnold was the British sloop <strong>HMS George</strong>. Arnold quickly manned the warship and renamed her <strong>Enterprise</strong>. At the time, <strong>Enterprise</strong> and the ships in her squadron were charged with maintaining American control of the lake early in the war.</li>
             </ol>    
           <li>Considered the most significant warship on Lake Champlain at the time.</li>
           <li>Fought valiantly during the Battle of Valcour Island.</li>
           <li>Disrupted British plans to invade New York.</li>
           <li>Grounded and burned intentionally to prevent capture prior to the Battle of Saratoga in 1777.</li>
         </ol>
     
       <li>The third <strong>Enterprise</strong>
         <ol type="a">
           <li>Fired the first shots of the Barbary Wars in 1801.</li>
           <li>Captured the corsair Tripoli, resulting in a humiliating defeat of the Pasha of Tripoli.</li>
         </ol>
    
       <li>The seventh <strong>Enterprise</strong> (CV-6)</li>
         <ol type="a">
           <li>Instrumental in the U.S. victory at the Battle of Midway.</li>
           <ol type="1">
           <li>Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Navy learned that the Imperial Japanese Navy planned to capture Midway Island.</li>
           <li>Aircraft from three carriers (the <strong>Yorktown</strong>, which was heavily damaged at the Battle of Coral Sea, the <strong>Hornet</strong>, and the <strong>Enterprise</strong>.) engaged and destroyed the four attacking Japanese carriers and won a victory from which the Japanese navy never recovered.</li>
         </ol>
       <li>The most decorated warship of World War II</li>
     </ol>
 
   <li>The eighth <strong>Enterprise</strong> (CVN-65)</li>
     <ol type="a">
       <li>Commissioned as the world&#8217;s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.</li>
       <ol type="1">
       <li>With eight nuclear reactors and a speed in excess of 35 knots, <strong>Enterprise</strong> remains one of the most powerful warships ever built.</li>
     </ol>
     <li>Participated in the naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis</li>
     <li>Became the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to see combat when she fought during the Vietnam War.</li>
 </ol>

</ol>
<li><strong>USS Bonhomme Richard</strong>
 <ol type="1">
   <li>&ldquo;A Ship for All Ages,&rdquo; was given the U.S. by France:</li>
     <ol type="a">
       <li>Originally named <strong>Duc De Duras</strong></li>
       <li>Boasted 42 guns of various caliber and was 152 feet long</li>
       <li>Renames by John Paul Jones in honor of Benjamin Franklin</li>
       <li>Engaged <strong>HMS Serapis</strong> in British waters on 23 September 1779</li>
       <ol type="1">
       <li>The <strong>Serapis-a</strong> frigate of 44 guns-was the lead ship of the British squadron.</li>
       <li>For three and a half hours, the two ships dueled. <strong>Serapis</strong> appeared to be winning and relentlessly fired upon <strong>Bonhomme Richard</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Asked to strike his colors, Captain John Paul Jones rallied his crew by declaring: &ldquo;I have not yet begun to fight!&rdquo; <strong>Bonhomme Richard</strong> won the battle, but sank the next day.</li>
      </ol>

<li>The <strong>USS Bonhomme Richard</strong> has its own legacy of greatness. Three U.S. warships have been commissioned <strong>Bonhomme Richard</strong>:</li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li>The second was CV/CVA-31, an Essex-class aircraft carrier that saw much action during World War II.</li>
     <ol>
       <li>Took part in numerous Pacific battles, including the final raids on Japan.</li>
       <li>Also saw action during the Korean War and made five war patrols during the Vietnam War.</li>
       <li>An illustrious and highly decorated warship, was decommissioned in July 1971.</li>
     </ol>

   <li>The third is currently the LHD-6, a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship</li>
     <ol>
       <li>A massive vessel, built specifically to deploy Fleet Expeditionary Marine forces.</li>
       <li>The current <strong>Bonhomme Richard</strong> has seen action in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM.</li>
     </ol>  
  </ol>
</ol>
</ol>

<li class="head-1">Events That Etched Ships In History</li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li>Significant events that occur on or about a ship often result in an inseparable connection and historic record.</li>
   <li>Many U.S. Navy world-wide &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; are associated with warships</li>
   <li>Some events were so profound, they changed the Navy forever.</li>
   <li>The American Civil War and the Ironclads</li>
   <ol type="1">
   <li>The Industrial Revolution brought a new level of mechanization to warships.</li>
   <li>Confederate forces modified the captured Union steamship <strong>Merrimack</strong> and pressed it into service as the <strong>CSS Virginia</strong>.</li>
   <li>The Battle of Hampton Roads on 8 March 1862:</li>
     <ol type="a">
       <li>Virginia approached the Union blockade line and proceeded to ram and sink the <strong>USS Cumberland</strong>, then set fire to <strong>USS Congress</strong> and caused the <strong>USS Minnesota</strong> to run aground as she fled the fight.</li>
       <li>The next day, <strong>Virginia</strong> again approached Hampton Roads to finish the battle and found the <strong>USS Monitor</strong>, an ironclad of two guns, waiting.</li>
       <li>The four-hour battle failed to produce a clear victor, it shocked navies around the world into the realization that all other types of warships were obsolete.</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>A distinct characteristic of future ships would be the turreted gun, first used on the <strong>USS Monitor</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
</ol>
<li>The Battle of Hampton Roads and the clash of the ironclads proved once and for all that warship design had changed forever.</li>
<li><strong>USS Missouri</strong> There have been three ships named <strong>USS Missouri</strong>:</li>
 <ol type="1">
  <li>A frigate</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Accidentally caught fire, exploded, and sank in the Gibraltar harbor while on a voyage to Egypt.</li>
    </ol>
 
  <li>A Maine-Class Battleship (BB-11)</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Part of the Great White Fleet</li>
    </ol>

  <li>An Iowa-Class Battleship (BB-63)</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The most advanced battleship ever constructed.</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Boasted an armament of nine 16-inch guns, and 20 five-inch guns.</li>
          <li>A single shell from her 16-inch guns could travel nearly 20 miles, and create a crater almost a hundred feet in diameter.</li>
          <li>Capable of speeds greater than 30 knots and equipped with radar and fire control systems that were far superior to comparable Japanese systems.</li>
        </ol>
   
      <li><strong>USS Missouri</strong> was the flagship of Admiral William &ldquo;Bull&rdquo; Halsey, and was the site of Japan&#8217;s surrender to the Allies-ending World War II.</li>
      <li><strong>USS Missouri</strong> saw action in World War II, Korea, and, after recommissioning in 1986, the 1991 Gulf War.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<li><strong>USS Nautilus</strong> (SSN-571)</li>
 <ol>
   <li>SSN-571 was the sixth vessel in the Navy to bear the name <strong>Nautilus</strong>.</li>
    <ol type="a">
     <li>Two schooners,</li>
     <li>One motor patrol boat</li>
     <li>Three submarines</li>
   </ol>

 <li>Distinguished as the world&#8217;s <strong>first</strong> nuclear-powered submarine.</li>
 <li>On 17 January 1955, she sent the famous message; &ldquo;Underway on nuclear power.&rdquo;</li>
 <li>The first submarine to navigate under the arctic ice.</li>
 <li>Ushered in the age of nuclear propulsion and rendered many anti-submarine warfare techniques developed during WWII obsolete.</li>
</ol>


</ol>

<li class="head-1">Enlisted Heroes - &ldquo;Above and Beyond the Call of Duty&rdquo; America&#8217;s Sailors have played vital roles in Navy victories, and achieved results that have influenced the course of history. America recognized its Sailors by bestowing its highest honors upon them.</li>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>Seaman Apprentice Douglas Hegdahl</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Served as an ammunition handler aboard <strong>USS Canberra</strong> (CA-70)</li>
      <li>Fell overboard and was captured by the North Vietnamese 5 April 1967</li>
      <li>Imprisoned at the &ldquo;Hanoi Hilton&rdquo; until 4 August 1969</li>
      <li>While a Prisoner of War, Hegdahl served as a vital link in the prisoners&#8217; communication network, passing messages among the captives.</li>
      <li>Memorized the names, along with their social security numbers and other identifying data which confirmed the status of Hanoi&#8217;s 256 POW&#8217;s and ended America&#8217;s low-key approach to Vietnam&#8217;s abuse of its captives.</li>
    </ol>
 
  <li>BMCM Carl Brashear</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Enlisted in 1948, after African-Americans were allowed to serve in all Navy units.</li>
      <li>Graduated from the Dive and Salvage School, and was later designated the Navy&#8217;s first African-American Master Diver.</li>
      <li>Severed his left leg in an accident, but was still able to shove several Sailors out of harm&#8217;s way-for which he received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his heroism for that selfless act.</li>
      <li>Became the first amputee ever to certify, and recertify, as a Navy diver.</li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>He served for more than a decade as an amputee.</li>
        </ol>
  
      <li>Retired in 1979; died 25 July 2006.</li>
    </ol>

  <li>Pharmacist&#8217;s Mate First Class Francis Junior Pierce</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Enlisted on 7 December 1941</li>
      <li>Completed training as a Hospital Corpsman, and subsequently assigned to Medical Company B, 4th Marine Division.</li>
      <li>Tended to wounded Marines during the Battle of Iwo Jima</li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>On 15 March 1945, while helping and evacuating wounded Marines during bitter fighting, he deliberately exposed himself to enemy fire to protect the wounded men under his care-eventually carrying two of them to safety while under fore across open terrain.</li>
          <li>Although seriously wounded on 16 March, while providing aid to a wounded Marine, he disregarded his own injuries and treated the Marine while firing on the enemy to provide cover for his fellow troops.</li>
        </ol>
   
      <li>Received the Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, and Silver Star for &ldquo;gallantry and intrepidity&rdquo;</li>
    </ol>

  <li>BM1 James E. Williams</li>
   <ol>
     <li>Petty Officer Williams is the most decorated enlisted Sailor in history.</li>
       <ol type="a">
         <li>During his career, earned the Navy Cross, two Silver stars, the Legion of Merit with Valor device, two Navy and Marine Corps Medals, three Bronze Stars, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, three Navy Commendation Medals, three Purple Hearts and numerous campaign and service medals.</li>
       </ol>

     <li>He enlisted in the Navy in 1947 and fought in the Korean and Vietnam wars.</li>
     <li>He volunteered for a final combat tour in Vietnam less than a year before his retirement, where, during one three-hour battle, he inspired his squadron to destroy 65 enemy craft.</li>
     <li>For actions during his last tour of duty, he received the Medal of Honor.</li>
     <li>The USS James E. Williams (DDG-95) is named in his honor.</li>
   </ol>

</ol>

<li class="head-1">Why The Navy is Important America has always relied upon the sea. America was founded by colonists who crossed the sea to settle upon its shores. The seas then became both a vital natural resource and a path by which America achieved its status as a world power.</li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li>Few in Congress wanted a navy after the War of Independence.</li>
     <ol>
      <li>The ships that fought in the War of Independence were sold, dismantled, or returned to merchants.</li>
    </ol>

  <li>The Royal Navy continued pressuring American Sailors into service.</li>
  <li>Establishment of trade relations with other nations was vital to the United States&#8217; growth.</li>
  <li>The United States&#8217; economy was vulnerable without a navy to protect it.</li>
  <li>Barbary States captured American vessels and ransomed their Sailors</li>
   <ol>
     <li><u>Barbary States</u> - The term used by Europeans from the 16th until the 19th century in reference to the coastal regions of what are now Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya.</li>
   </ol>

 <li>Tribute being paid to the Barbary States wounded America&#8217;s pride.</li>
   <ol>
     <li><u>Tribute</u> - A bribe paid to a nation-state for safe passage through the territory or waters under their control.</li>
   </ol>

 <li>Mounting shipping losses created a demand for a navy. The Constitution made government responsible for maintaining a navy.</li>
   <ol>
     <li>Article one, section eight made the Legislative Branch of government responsible for maintaining a navy.</li>
     <li>This clause proved essential to the rise of a navy.</li>
   </ol>

 <li>The Naval Act of 1794 authorized the construction of the first six frigates.</li>
   <ol>
     <li>They were designed to out-fight and out-sail anything in their class.</li>
     <li>Cost of $300,000 each.</li>
   </ol>

 <li>The United States Navy proved itself essential to protecting seaborne commerce.</li>
 <li>National pride was restored through naval victories.</li>
</ol>
<li class="head-1">A Modern Navy Is Vital to Our Nation&#8217;s Continued Growth</li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li>The success of the Navy&#8217;s first six frigates demonstrated the need to protect merchant shipping and the importance of global commerce to America&#8217;s growth.</li>
   <li>In the 1800&#8217;s, a landward expansion under &ldquo;Manifest Destiny&rdquo; hampered the Navy&#8217;s growth.</li>
     <ol>
       <li>Offered fierce competition for resources that might otherwise have been invested in building the Navy.</li>
       <li>Little was done to advance naval thought or equipment during this time.</li>
     </ol>

   <li>Beginning with a successful public campaign to save the USS Constitution in 1833, the American people began to identify with their Navy.</li>
   <li>Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan&#8217;s book, &ldquo;The Influence of Sea Power on History, 1660-1783&rdquo;:</li>
     <ol>
       <li>A compelling book that forever changed the way America viewed its sea power.</li>
       <li>Convinced the United States that a navy was necessary.</li>
       <li>Argued that the United States required a large, modern fleet of steam-powered warships.</li>
       <li>Demonstrated that a navy was vital to protecting commerce and winning wars.</li>
       <li>Showed the nations that did not have navies were at the mercy of those who did.</li>
     </ol>

 </ol>


<li class="head-1">The Character of Navies</li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li>Nations must balance the cost of their navy with other priorities.</li>
   <li>There are many types of navies in the world.</li>
     <ol>
       <li>Small navies for coastal defense and law enforcement.</li>
         <ol type="a">
           <li>Enabling them to protect their harbors and waterways.</li>
         </ol>
  
       <li>Provide self-defense and law enforcement capabilities for their nations.</li>
       <li>Large navies are built to:</li>
         <ol type="a">
           <li>Defeat an enemy&#8217;s fleet at sea,</li>
           <li>Blockade an enemy&#8217;s ports,</li>
           <li>Protect its own or hurt an enemy&#8217;s seagoing commerce,</li>
           <li>Transport or deliver troops ashore,</li>
           <li>Project military power from the sea (strike warfare).</li>
         </ol>
     
       <li>United States&#8217; roles and responsibilities are global in scale</li>
         <ol type="a">
           <li>Requires a large navy capable of worldwide operations to fulfill its obligations.</li>
         </ol>
     
     </ol>

   <li>Navies are very expensive and cost limits a navy&#8217;s size and what it can do.</li>
    <li>Navies share the following characteristics:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a long time to build</li>
       <ol type="a">
         <li>Some ships require as many as seven years to complete.</li>
       </ol>
   
     <li>Very costly to operate and maintain</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The cost of operating a single American aircraft carrier for one year exceeds the entire defense budget of many nations (and may exceed the gross domestic product (GDP) of some).</li>
      </ol>

    <li>Require years of training and practice to operate effectively.</li>
    <li>Require constant modernization to avoid obsolescence.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Modernization adds considerable costa to an already expensive fleet.</li>
        <li>Both ships and their weapon systems require continuing process of upgrade or replacement in order to meet current and emerging threats.</li>
      </ol>
   
  </ol>

</ol>

<li class="head-1">The Case for a Powerful Navy The writings of Rear Admiral Mahan and others firmly established the need for the world&#8217;s powers to build and maintain large navies to protect themselves and their interests around the globe.</li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li>Competition between nations led to the evolution of two types of power. The world powers fall into two basic types:</li>
     <ol>
