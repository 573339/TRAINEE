                <li><span class="list-number">(1)</span>In 1861, French inventor Brutus De Villeroi convinced the Union Navy that he could build a submersible warship. The 47-foot, oar-propelled Alligator became the first submersible Navy warship.</li>
                <li><span class="list-number">(2)</span>The Alligator was unable to complete its first mission because it was underpowered, unwieldy and unsafe</li>
                <li><span class="list-number">(3)</span>In 1900, the Navy purchased and commissioned the USS Holland (SS-1), propelled by a 45-horsepower engine with a speed of 6 knots. The Holland held a crew of six, carried three torpedoes and a topside gun.</li>
