  <h2>A. Introduction</h2>
  <p>We conduct dangerous or risky actions without realizing it. In the Navy, risky behavior can endanger the lives of many. Operational Risk Management (ORM) is an integral part of the decision-making process for all Navy personnel, on or off duty. TCRM refers to apply ORM at the point of commencing or during execution of a mission or task.</p>

  <li class="head-1">Introduction</li>
  <li class="head-1">What is Time-Critical Risk Management (TCRM)?</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Time Critical Risk Management (TCRM) is using risk management concepts when time and resources are limited.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>The ABCD Model is based on fundamental scientific principles, ability to focus individuals, increase their situational awareness (SA), and improve their performance in the time critical environment.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>TCRM model consists of graphic representations or icons and the easy to remember mnemonic ABCD.</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>A-Assess the situation.</li>
          <li>B-Balance Resources.</li>
          <li>C-Communicate to others.</li>
          <li>D-Do the event and Debrief.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li>TCRM plays a role in improving our chance of completing the task or mission successfully.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The nature of TCRM decisions includes an understanding that:</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Using the ABCD Model daily creates a habit and trains the brain to continue thinking under stress or duress. The model is designed to assist when:</li>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Working in a changing environment.</li>
        <li>Monitoring a static or routine situation to capture errors.</li>
        <li>Making a decision with partial information.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>In all three situations, it’s necessary to develop habits that trigger the TCRM process to “Assess”, “Balance”, “Communicate”, “Do and Debrief” the event continuously as necessary.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <li class="head-1">The ABCD Model of Risk Management</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The visual reminder or ABCD (icon) assists in the recall of the concepts and the principles behind the ABCD’s and improves communications during the event.</li>
    <li>The Model provides a common language and structure for a measured response when an individual, team or crew is executing a routine task, or when under stress from a more complex situation.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>In the execution of the task or mission, where time and resources are most limited, an individual must be proactive and responsive to ensure success.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The ABCD model establishes a structure for standardized thought and communication while executing a task.</li>
        <li>Using the ABCD model daily will result in deep memory of those learned qualities.</li>
        <li>When executing tasks, leadership and team members have an expectation of a response similar to their experience.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Assess the situation - In a real-time situation, it is essential to consider the event.</li>
       <ol type="a">
        <li>Are things going as planned?</li>
        <li>What’s different from the plan?</li>
        <li>What’s confusing me?</li>
        <li>What will happen next?</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>

    <li>Situational Awareness (SA)</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Situational Awareness refers to the degree of accuracy by which your perception of the current environment mirrors reality.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>What’s going on?</li>
        <li>What’s going to happen next?</li>
        <li>Real risk vs. perceived risk.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>

    <li>Situational Awareness-Risk.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Risk is gauged in three colors:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Green -- Little chance of serious error. Errors may be made but should be caught by the individual.</li>
        <li>Yellow -- Higher chance of serious error. Stressed or less focused on task and surroundings. Errors possibly not caught.</li>
        <li>Red -- Very high chance of serious error. Error that cannot be caught.</li>
        <li>Swooshing Arrow -- Return to good situation awareness.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The target is used during team communication to focus one or more individuals on an understanding of situational conditions or an individual can use it as a self-assessment.</li>
    </ol>

    <li>Warning signs of Individual Risk</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Operating a vehicle</li>
      <ol type="a">
