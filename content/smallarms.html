            <li><span class="list-number">b.</span>There are four rules that must be observed at all times, whether in training or in combat. These rules are the foundation for responsible weapons handling.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="list-number">(1)</span>Rule 1: Treat every weapon as if it were loaded. This rule is intended to prevent unintentional injury to personnel or damage to property from handling or transferring possession of a weapon.</li>
                <li><span class="list-number">(2)</span>Rule 2: Never point a weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot. This rule enforces the importance of muzzle awareness and reinforces positive identification of target.</li>
                <li><span class="list-number">(3)</span>Rule 3: Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you are ready to fire. This rule is intended to minimize the risk of firing the weapon negligently, and reinforces positive identification of target.</li>
                <li><span class="list-number">(4)</span>Rule 4: Keep weapon on SAFE until you intend to fire. This rule enforces the use of the weapons safety feature(s), and reinforces positive identification of target.</li>

                    <li><span class="list-number">(a)</span>Ocular Dominance, (sometimes called eye dominance) -- The tendency to prefer visual input from one eye to the other.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="list-number">1)</span>The shooter extends both arms, brings both hands together to create a small opening then with both eyes open views a distant object through the opening.</li>
                        <li><span class="list-number">2)</span>The observer then alternates closing the eyes or slowly draws opening back to the head to determine which eye is viewing the object (i.e., the dominant eye).</li>

                        <li><span class="list-number">1)</span>There are instances when the eye which has the poorest vision is not included in the act of vision and the person actually uses just one eye, the better one.</li>
                        <li><span class="list-number">2)</span>The dominance of one eye over the other also occurs, even when both eyes possess identical sharpness of vision.</li>
                        <li><span class="list-number">3)</span>Binocular Aiming -- Both eyes open, the line of sight still is achieved with one eye the dominate eye. This method does not require the shooter to learn something new or to relearn something, the shooter must simply stop closing one eye when aiming.</li>

            <li><span class="list-number">b.</span>A firm grip is essential for good trigger control.</li>
            <li><span class="list-number">c.</span>The grip is established before applying trigger control and is maintained throughout the firing process.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-number">(a)</span>It is necessary to apply pressure on the trigger either with the first bone section of the index finger, or with the first joint.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-number">(b)</span>The trigger must be pressed straight to the rear. If the finger presses the trigger to the side, undesirable things will happen.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-number">(c)</span>Only slight pressure to the side is required to bring about an error in sight alignment.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-number">(d)</span>The prime cause of exerting pressure to the side is improper placement of the trigger finger.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-number">(e)</span>The sights are aligned while pressure applied to the trigger.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="list-number">1)</span>As pressure is applied to the trigger, the sights move.</li>
                        <li><span class="list-number">2)</span>Sight alignment and trigger control must be performed simultaneously to make an accurate shot.</li>
                    </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-number">(a)</span>The shooter applies a steady, unchanging pressure to the trigger until the shot is fired.</li>

                        <li><span class="list-number">1)</span>Apply pressure on the trigger while maintaining focus on the top edge of the front sight.</li>

                        <li><span class="list-number">1)</span>If the sight picture is outside the aiming area, the shooter stops the rearward movement until sight picture is reestablished.</li>
                        <li><span class="list-number">2)</span>When sight picture is reestablished, the rearward movement of the trigger is continued until the shot is fired.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-number">(a)</span>The object is to hold your breath just long enough to fire the shot while maintaining sight alignment and sight picture.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-number">(b)</span>Breathing causes movement of the chest, abdomen, and shoulders, which causes the weapon to move while attempting to fire.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-number">(c)</span>Holding breath too long can result in increased heart rate, muscle fatigue, and eye fatigue reducing shot accuracy.</li>
