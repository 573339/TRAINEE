    <h4>What foods are in the grain group?</h4>
    <p>Any food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley or another cereal grain is a grain product. Bread, pasta, oatmeal, breakfast cereals, tortillas, and grits are examples of grain products.</p>
    <p>Grains are divided into 2 subgroups, <strong>whole grains and refined grains.</strong></p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="  section1">
  <div class="col-xs-5 col-sm-5 col-md-5 col-lg-5">
    <p>Whole grains contain the entire grain kernel -- the bran, germ, and endosperm. Examples include:</p>
    <ul class="grain-list">
      <li>Whole-Wheat Flour</li>
      <li>Whole Cornmeal</li>
      <li>Bulgur (Cracked Wheat)</li>
      <li>Bn Rice</li>
      <li>Oatmeal</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-7 col-sm-7 col-md-7 col-lg-7">
    <p>Refined grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ. This is done to give grains a finer texture and improve their shelf life, but it also removes dietary fiber, iron, and many B vitamins. Some examples of refined grain products are:</p>
    <ul class="grain-list">
      <li>White Flour</li>
      <li>White Rice</li>
      <li>Degermed Cornmeal</li>
      <li>White Bread</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="section">Most refined grains are enriched. This means certain B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid) and iron are added back after processing. Fiber is not added back to enriched grains. Check the ingredient list on refined grain products to make sure that the word “enriched” is included in the grain name. Some food products are made from mixtures of whole grains and refined grains.</p>

    <h5><sup>*</sup>Selection Tips</h5>
    <p class="section1">Choose fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese. If you choose milk or yogurt that is not fat-free, or cheese that is not low-fat, the fat in the product counts against your maximum limit for "empty calories" (calories from solid fats and added sugars).</p>
    <p class="section1">If sweetened milk products are chosen (flavored milk, yogurt, drinkable yogurt, desserts), the added sugars also count against your maximum limit for "empty calories" (calories from solid fats and added sugars).</p>
    <p class="section1">For those who are lactose intolerant, smaller portions (such as 4 fluid ounces of milk) may be well tolerated. Lactose-free and lower-lactose products are available. These include lactose-reduced or lactose-free milk, yogurt, and cheese, and calcium-fortified soymilk (soy beverage). Also, enzyme preparations can be added to milk to lower the lactose content. Calcium-fortified foods and beverages such as cereals, orange juice, or rice or almond beverages may provide calcium, but may not provide the other nutrients found in dairy products.</p>
    <blockquote><strong>Key:</strong> Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk.</blockquote>

      <p>All foods made from meat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts, and seeds are considered part of the Protein Foods Group. Beans and peas are also part of the Vegetable Group. For more information on beans and peas, see Beans and Peas Are Unique Foods.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Select a variety of protein foods to improve nutrient intake and health benefits, including at least 8 ounces of cooked seafood per week. Young children need less, depending on their age and calories needs. The advice to consume seafood does not apply to vegetarians. Vegetarian options in the Protein Foods Group include beans and peas, processed soy products, and nuts and seeds. Meat and poultry choices should be lean or low-fat.</p>

  <h5><sup>*</sup>Selection Tips</h5>
  <p class="section1">Choose lean or low-fat meat and poultry. If higher fat choices are made, such as regular ground beef (75 to 80% lean) or chicken with skin, the fat counts against your maximum limit for empty calories (calories from solid fats or added sugars).</p>
  <p class="section1">If solid fat is added in cooking, such as frying chicken in shortening or frying eggs in butter or stick margarine, this also counts against your maximum limit for empty calories (calories from solid fats and added sugars).</p>
  <p class="section1">Select some seafood that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, trout, sardines, anchovies, herring, Pacific oysters, and Atlantic and Pacific mackerel.</p>
  <p class="section1">Processed meats such as ham, sausage, frankfurters, and luncheon or deli meats have added sodium. Check the Nutrition Facts label to help limit sodium intake. Fresh chicken, turkey, and pork that have been enhanced with a salt-containing solution also have added sodium. Check the product label for statements such as “self-basting” or “contains up to __% of __”, which mean that a sodium-containing solution has been added to the product.</p>
  <p>Choose unsalted nuts and seeds to keep sodium intake low.</p>
