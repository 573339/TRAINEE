      <li class="head-1">Relationship between the Navy Core Values and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Service members occupy a unique position in society and represent the military establishment. That status brings with it a responsibility to uphold and maintain the military’s dignity and high standards.</li>
        <li>Service members must possess high standards of morale, good order, discipline, and cohesion. As a result, military laws, rules, customs, and traditions include restrictions on personal behavior that may be different from civilian life.</li>
        <li>The unique nature of military service requires regulation of behavior that brings discredit on the Military Services, adversely affects good order and discipline, or is inconstant with military customs, traditions, and decorum.</li>
        <li>The UCMJ is the legal foundation of good order and discipline in the Military Services and is used to enforce this higher standard.</li>
        <li>The Navy Core Values are the principles that define the standard every Sailor is expected to maintain. They relate directly to the UCMJ.</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li><ins>Honor</ins> To behave within the guidelines of the UCMJ is the honorable duty of every sailor.</li>
          <li><ins>Courage</ins> When tempted by others, have the courage to comply with the UCMJ.</li>
