However, the U.S. government and allied governments may enter into a dialogue with representatives of those holding hostages in order to endure the safe return of all isolated personnel.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">C.</span>Scope</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>Military personnel should follow guidance from the Code of Conduct.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>The Code of Conduct is a moral guide designed to assist military personnel in combat or being held as prisoners of war to live up to the ideals contained in the DoD policy.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>DoD civilians, DoD contractors (under the terms of the contract), family members, and other designated personnel should know their personal legal status under the Geneva Conventions.

This exploitation can take many forms, but each form of exploitation is designed to assist the foreign government or the terrorist captors.</li><li><span class="list-number">2.</span>In the past, terrorists or governments exploited detainees for information and propaganda efforts, including confessions to crimes never committed.  This assisted or lent credibility to the detainer.</li><li><span class="list-number">3.</span>Governments also have been exploited in such a situation to make damaging statements about themselves or to force them to appear weal in relation to other governments.</li><li><span class="list-number">4.</span>Governments have paid ransoms for captives of terrorists and such payments have improved terrorist finances, supplies, status, and operations, often prolonging the terror carried on by such groups.</li><li><span class="list-number">5.</span>The U.S. government policy is that it will not negotiate with terrorists.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">F.</span>Responsibility</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>The U.S. government will make every good-faith effort to obtain the earliest release of DoD personnel (and their family members), whether detainees or hostages.</li><li><span class="list-number">2.</span>Faith in one’s country and its way of life, faith in fellow detainees or captives, and faith in one’s self are critical to surviving with honor and resisting exploration.</li><li><span class="list-number">3.</span>Resisting exploitation and having faith in these areas are the responsibility of all Americans.</li><li><span class="list-number">4.</span>On the other hand, the destruction of such faith must be the assumed goal of all captors determined to maximize their gains from a detention or hostage situation.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">G.</span>Goal</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>DoD personnel must take every reasonable step to prevent exploitation of themselves and the U.S. government.</li><li><span class="list-number">2.</span>If the captive cannot prevent exploitation completely, the captive must take every step to limit exploitation as much as possible.</li><li><span class="list-number">3.</span>Detained DoD personnel often are catalysts for their own release, based on their ability to become unattractive sources of exploitation; e.g., one who resists successfully may expect detainers to lose interest in further exploitation attempts.</li><li><span class="list-number">4.</span>Detainees or hostages must make their own judgments as to how their actions will increase their chances of returning home with honor and dignity.</li><li><span class="list-number">5.</span>Without exception, the military member who may say honestly that he or she has done his or her utmost in a detention or hostage situation to resist exploitation upholds DoD policy, the founding principles of the United States, and the highest traditions of military service.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">H.</span>Military Bearing and Courtesy</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>U.S. military personnel will maintain their military bearing, regardless of the type of detention or captivity or harshness of treatment.</li><li><span class="list-number">2.</span>They should make every effort to remain calm, courteous, and project personal dignity.  That is particularly important during the process of capture and the early stages of internment when the captors may be uncertain of their control over the captives.</li><li><span class="list-number">3.</span>Discourteous, nonmilitary behavior seldom serves the long-term interest of a detainee or hostage and often results in unnecessary punishment that serves no useful purpose.</li><li><span class="list-number">4.</span>In some situations, such behavior may jeopardize survival and severely complicate efforts to fain release of the detainee or hostage.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">I.</span>Classified Information</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>There are no circumstances in which a detainee or hostage should voluntarily give classified information or materials to those unauthorized to receive them.</li><li><span class="list-number">2.</span>To the utmost of their ability, DoD personnel held as detainees or hostages will protect all classified information.  An unauthorized disclosure of classified information, for whatever reason, does not justify further disclosures.</li><li><span class="list-number">3.</span>Detainees and hostages must resist, to the utmost of their ability, each and every attempt by their captor to obtain such information.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">J.</span>Military Chain of Command</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>In group detention, captivity, or hostage situations, military detainees or hostages will organize, to the fullest extent possible, in a military manner under the senior military member present and eligible to command.</li><li><span class="list-number">2.</span>The importance of such organization cannot be overemphasized.  Historically, in both peacetime and wartime, establishment of a military chain of command has been a tremendous source of strength for all captives.</li><li><span class="list-number">3.</span>Every effort will be made to establish and sustain communications with other detainees or hostages.  Military detainees or hostages will encourage civilians being held with them to participate in the military organization and accept the authority of the senior military member.</li><li><span class="list-number">4.</span>In some circumstances, such as embassy duty, military members may be under the direction of a senior U.S. civilian official.  Notwithstanding such circumstances, the senior military member still is obligated to establish, as an entity, a military organization and to ensure that the guidelines in support of the DoD policy to survive with honor are not compromised.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">K.</span>Guidance for Detention by Hostile Governments (Detainee)</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>DoD personnel must be aware that the basic protections available to prisoners of war under the third Geneva Convention (Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War) may not be provided, as these protections apply only during declared war or international armed conflict.  Otherwise, combatants will receive only the minimum protections of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention.</li><li><span class="list-number">2.</span>As a result, detained DoD personnel may be subject to the domestic criminal laws of the detaining nation.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>For example, if a U.S. person kills a civilian to avoid detection by a hostile force, the individual may face prosecution under the laws of the detaining nation.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>In addition to the Geneva Conventions, there may also be a status of forces agreement or some other binding agreement that provides certain parameters for the duties of the detaining government.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Detainees should attempt to maintain military bearing, if possible, and should avoid aggressive or combative behavior that would violate the criminal or civil laws of the subject country.</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>However, detainees should not forget that they have an inherent right of self-defense.  DoD personnel must be prepared to assess the dangers associated with being taken into captivity by local authorities.</li><li><span class="list-number">e.</span>Their assessment of the dangers should dictate what efforts should be taken and what measure of force may be required to avoid capture, resist apprehension, and resist cooperation once captured.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">3.</span>Governments are obligated to notify the detainee’s consular officials.</li><li><span class="list-number">4.</span>As U.S. citizens, detainees should immediately and continually ask to see U.S. Embassy personnel or a representative of an allied or neutral government.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Escape attempts from governmental detention are not recommended, except under unique or life-threatening circumstances.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Although escape is considered a last resort, it may become necessary if conditions deteriorate to the point that the risks associated with escape are less than the risks of remaining captive. These risks would include the death of detainees due to treatment by the detainers or the credible threat of death or torture of the detainees by the detainers.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Because escape from government detention is a crime in most countries, a failed escape attempt may provide the detainer with further justification to prolong detention by adding additional criminal or civil charges.</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>This would be particularly true if detaining government personnel or civilians were wounded or killed during an escape by or because of the detainee.  A detainee in this case may be subjected to severe punishment at the hands of the detainer’s legal system that may result in bodily harm or even death to the detainee.</li></ul></ul><li><span class="list-number">L.</span>Guidance for Captivity by Terrorists (Hostage)</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>Capture by terrorists is generally the least predictable and structured form of captivity.  The captor may qualify as an international criminal.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Tension levels will be extremely high during the initial seizing of hostages.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Terrorists will likely feel most vulnerable at this point.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Hostages should reduce this tension level by controlling their emotions, following instructions as far as practicable, and avoiding physical resistance.</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>Sudden movement or action could precipitate a deadly response.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">2.</span>One recommendation is for military personnel to obtain a U.S. tourist passport to assist in blending in with other travelers and to delay the initial identification process in a hostage situation.</li><li><span class="list-number">3.</span>Surrender the tourist passport if the terrorists demand identification during the initial stage, or delay identification as a U.S. military or official traveler by claiming inability to locate the documents.</li><li><span class="list-number">4.</span>If directly confronted about the DoD status, lying is not recommended.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>The initial delay serves only to maximize survival during the initial stage.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Hostages should leave evidence of their presence whenever and wherever possible.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Leaving fingerprints can assist in locating hostages.</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>DNA, in the form of hair strands with root or drops of blood, should also be inconspicuously deposited when feasible.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">5.</span>Escape from terrorists is risky but may become necessary if conditions deteriorate to the point that the risks associated with escape are less than the risks of remaining captive.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>These risks would include torture, the death of hostages due to treatment or the credible threat of death.</li></ul></ul><li><span class="list-number">M.</span>Personal Data</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>Law enforcement agencies need timely and accurate information in the event of an emergency.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Military personnel, DoD civilians and contractors are required to fill out DD Form 1833, Isolated Personnel Report, before deploying.</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>While much of the same material requested below appears on the DD Form 1833, it is a classified document when completed and will not be available to local law enforcement or other non-DoD agencies.</li></ul></ul><li><span class="list-number">N.</span>For Additional Information</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>The following Web sites may provide useful information about recent threats or activities, in addition to installation-specific Web sites.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>U.S. Department of Homeland Security  http://www.dhs.gov and http://www.ready.gov</li><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>Federal Emergency Management Agency  http://www.fema.gov</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>The American Red Cross  http://www.redcross.org</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  https://emergency.cdc.gov</li><li><span class="list-number">e.</span>U.S. Department of State  http://travel.state.gov or http://www.state.gov</li></ul></ul><li><span class="list-number">O.</span>The Department of State has a travel registry for U.S. citizens living or traveling overseas called STEP (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program), this service is used to facilitate contact between the local U.S. Embassy or Consulate and the individual during times of emergencies.
