 <li class="head-1">Introduction</li>
 <li class="head-1">Safety procedures for handling and firing small arms</li>
 <ol type="1">
   <li><strong>Safety is the NUMBER ONE concern</strong> at Small Arms Marksmanship Trainer.</li>
   <li>Never pass a fire arm to another person, or accept a firearm from another person, until the slide or action is open and you&#8217;ve personally checked that the weapon is completely unloaded.</li>
   <li>Keep your weapon level at all times.</li>
   <li>Keep your eyes on the target.</li>
   <li>Never turn around while in the firing line.</li>
 </ol>

 <li class="head-1">Universal Weapons Safety Rules</li>
 <ol type="a">
   <li>Proper weapons handling is the responsibility of the person in control of the weapon.</li>
   <li>There are <strong>FOUR</strong> rules that must be observed at all times, whether in training or in combat. These rules are the foundation for responsible weapons handling.
     <ol>
       <li><strong><u>Rule 1:</u></strong> <strong>Treat</strong> every weapon as if it were loaded.
         <ol type="a">
           <li>This rule is intended to prevent unintentional injury to personnel or damage to property from handling or transferring possession of a weapon.</li>
         </ol>
       </li>
       <li><strong><u>Rule 2:</u></strong> <strong>Never</strong> point a weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot.</li>
       <ol type="a">
         <li>This rule enforces the importance of muzzle awareness and reinforces positive identification of target.</li>
       </ol>
     </li>
     <li><strong><u>Rule 3:</u></strong> <strong>Keep</strong> your finger straight and off the trigger until you are ready to fire.</li>
     <ol type="a">
       <li>This rule is intended to minimize the risk of firing the weapon negligently, and reinforces positive identification of target.</li>
     </ol>
   </li>
   <li><strong><u>Rule 4:</u></strong> <strong>Keep</strong> weapon on SAFE until you intend to fire.</li>
   <ol type="a">
     <li>This rule enforces the use of the weapons safety feature(s), and reinforces positive identification of target.</li>
   </ol>
 </ol>
</ol>
<li class="head-1">Range Safety Commands</li>
<ol type="a">
 <li>Standby</li>
 <ol>
   <li>Used as a preparatory command.</li>
   <li>Keep your finger OFF the trigger.</li>
   <li>Do NOT disengage the weapon&#8217;s safety.</li>
   <li>Keep weapon pointed down range in the Standing Ready Position.</li>
 </ol>
 <li>Commence Fire</li>
 <ol>
   <li>Used to begin the course of fire.</li>
   <li>Bring the weapon up to your eye level, aligned to the target. Sight in on the target.</li>
   <li>Disengage the weapon&#8217;s safety. Place your finger on the trigger and fire the specified number of rounds.</li>
 </ol>

 <li>Cease Fire</li>
 <ol>
   <li>Used to stop the current course of fire, either because of a set time limit or a dangerous situation which may have occurred while on the firing line.</li>
   <li>Remove their finger from the trigger.</li>
   <li>Place weapon of safe.</li>
   <li>Return to the standing ready position.</li>
   <li>Do NOT move until directed by a Line Coach or the Range Safety Officer (RSO).</li>
 </ol>
 
</ol>

<li class="head-1">Functions, Components and Characteristics of the 9mm Pistol</li>
<ol type="a">
 <li>Pistol Grip -- Portion of the mechanism that is held by the hand.</li>
 <ol>
  <li>Orients the hand in a manner similar to the position one would take with a conventional pistol.</li>
  <li>Generally used by the hand that operates the trigger.</li>
</ol>

<li>Magazine -- Stores 15 rounds of ammunition.</li>
<ol>
  <li>For this course, the magazine is permanently installed in the pistol and CANNOT be removed.</li>
</ol>

<li>Magazine Release Button -- Located at the junction of the trigger guard and pistol grip.</li>
<ol>
  <li>Has the advantage of speed I reloading while compromising some on the risk of accidental risk of dropping the magazine and,</li>
  <li>Requirement to have either comparatively ling thumbs or changing the hold on the weapon to actuate it. </li>
</ol>
<li>Front and Rear Sights -- An optical device used to assist aim by guiding the eye and aligning it with the weapon.</li>
<li>Trigger -- Initiates and controls firing of the pistol and is protected by the trigger guard.</li>
<li>Hammer -- When the trigger is squeezed, drops forward causing the round to fire.</li>
<li>Slide Assembly -- Part of a semi-automatic pistol that moves during the operating cycle.</li>
<ol>
  <li>Generally houses the firing pin or striker, extractor.</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Serves as the bolt face.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>	Spring loaded so that once it has moved to its rearmost point in the firing cycle, spring tension brings it back to chamber a fresh cartridge.</li>
</ol>

<li>Slide Stop -- On a semi-automatic pistol, is a device that locks the slide I the rearward position.
  <ol>
    <li>Visually indicates when a pistol has expended all loaded ammunition.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>	Decocking/Safety Lever
    <ol>
      <li>Safety or Safety Catch -- A mechanism used to prevent the accidental firing of a weapon, ensuring safer handling.</li>
      <li>Decocking/Safety Lever -- Allows the hammer to be dropped on a live cartridge without discharging, via disengaging, reacting or covering the firing pin.</li>
    </ol>

  </ol>
</li>
<li class="head-1">Hand Placement For the 9mm Pistol</li>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Proper hand Placement -- Provides the shooter with the maximum control of the weapon.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Hold the pistol in the weak hand; form a “V” with the thumb and forefinger of the strong hand.</li>
    <li>Place the pistol in the “V” with the front and rear sights, in line with the firing arm.</li>
    <li>Wrap the lower three fingers around the pistol grip, putting equal pressure with all three fingers to the rear.</li>
    <li>Allow the thumb to rest alongside the pistol without pressure.</li>
    <li>Close the fingers of your non-firing hand over three fingers of your firing hand, below the trigger guard.</li>
    <li>Place the non-firing thumb alongside the firing thumb.</li>

  </ol>

  <li>Transitioning to Weak Hand Grip</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Grip pistol with weak hand.</li>
    <li>Place heel of string hand on exposed portion of pistol grip in the pocket formed by fingertips and heel of weak hand.</li>
    <li>Wrap fingers of string hand over fingers of weak hand.</li>
    <li>Rest strong hand thumb alongside weak hand thumb.</li>
    <li>Rest trigger finger naturally, straight and outside of trigger guard alongside frame.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<li>9mm Pistol Stances</li>
<ol type="a">
 <li>	Standing Ready</li>
 <ol>
  <li>Face the target with feet approximately shoulder width apart.</li>
  <li>Feet and shoulders are squared to the target.</li>
  <li>Pistol will be down at the belt buckle and kept level and pointed down range.</li>
  <li>Trigger finger straight and OFF the trigger.</li>
</ol>

<li>Standing Isosceles</li>
<ol>
  <li>Face the target with feet approximately shoulder width apart.</li>
  <li>Feet and shoulders are squared to the target.</li>
  <li>Extend the arms toward the target.</li>
  <li>Lean forward with the shoulders rolled forward.</li>
</ol>

<li>Kneeling Position</li>
<ol>
  <li>Drop the right or left foot back.</li>
  <li>Place the right or left knee on the deck.</li>
  <li>Square the shoulders to the target.</li>
  <li>Lean forward with the shoulders rolled forward.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<li class="head-1">Sight Alignment</li>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Relationship between the front sight and the rear sight in respect to the shooter&#8217;s eye.</li>
  <li>The eye must be lined up with the front and rear sights and sights positioned so that their alignment is in the proper relationship with the target.</li>
  <li>There should be equal space on either side of the front sight.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Determining Eye Dominance</li>
    <ol type="a">
     <li>Ocular Dominance, (sometimes called eye dominance) -- The tendency to prefer visual input from one eye to the other.</li>
     <li>Somewhat similar to the laterality of right or left handedness; however,</li>
     <ol>
      <li>The side of the dominant eye and the dominant hand to not always match.</li>
    </ol>

    <li>The &ldquo;Miles Test&rdquo;</li>
    <ol>
     <li>The shooter extends both arms, brings both hands together to create a small opening then with both eyes open views a distant object through the opening.</li>
     <li>The observer then alternates closing the eyes or slowly draws opening back to the head to determine which eye is viewing the object (i.e., the dominant eye).</li>
   </ol>
 </ol>

 <li>Monocular/Binocular Aiming</li>
 <ol type="a">
  <li>Monocular -- Vision with one eye.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>There are instances when the eye which has the poorest vision is not included in the act of vision and the person actually uses just one eye, the better one.</li>
    <li>The dominance of one eye over the other also occurs, even when both eyes possess identical sharpness of vision.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>Binocular Aiming -- Both eyes open, the line of sight still is achieved with one eye.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Consequently, this method does not involve anything new in principle and therefore the shooter is not required wither to learn something new or to relearn something, but must simply stop closing one eye when aiming.</li>
  </ol>

</ol>
<li>Sight Picture -- The placement of the front sight in relation to the target while maintaining sight alignment.</li>
<ol type="a">
 <li>This is called a &ldquo;Center Mass Hold&rdquo;.</li>
 <li>Because the pistol is fired without benefit of bone support or a sling for support, the pistol sights are constantly moving.</li>
 <ol>
   <li>This means that sight alignment&#47;sight picture is constantly moving.</li>
   <li>Sight alignment and sight picture are acquired within an aiming area center mass on the target.</li>
 </ol>
</ol>

<li>Point of Focus</li>
<ol type="a">
 <li>The human eye can only focus clearly on one object at a time.</li>
 <li>The shooter must focus on the front sight while maintaining the alignment of the front and rear sight.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li class="head-1">Trigger Control</li>
<ol type="a">
 <li>The skillful manipulation of the trigger that causes the pistol to fire while maintaining sight alignment and sight picture.</li>
 <li>A firm grip is essential for good trigger control.</li>
 <li>The grip is established before applying trigger control and is maintained throughout the firing process.</li>
 <ol>
  <li>Finger Placement</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>It is necessary to apply pressure on the trigger with either the first bone section of the index finger, or with the first joint.</li>
    <li>The trigger must be pressed straight to the rear.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>If the finger presses the trigger to the side, undesirable things will happen.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Only slight pressure to the side is required to bring about an error in sight alignment.</li>
    <li>The prime cause of exerting pressure to the side id improper placement of the trigger finger.</li>
    <li>The sights are aligned with the pressure applied to the trigger.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>As pressure is applied to the trigger, the sights move.</li>
      <li>Sight alignment and trigger control must be performed simultaneous to make an accurate shot.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Uninterrupted Trigger Control</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The shooter applies a steady, unchanging pressure to the trigger until the shot is fired.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Apply pressure on the trigger while maintaining focus on the top edge of the front sight.</li>
      <li>Begin moving the trigger straight to the rear while maintaining sight alignment and sight picture.</li>
      <li>Move the trigger straight to the rear in a single smooth motion with no hesitation.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Interrupted Trigger Control</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The shooter takes up the trigger slack and applies initial pressure to the trigger to begin rearward movement.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>In the sight picture is outside the aiming area, the shooter stops the rearward movement until sight picture is reestablished.</li>
      <li>When sight picture is reestablished, the rearward movement of the trigger is continued until the shot is fired.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Breath Control</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The object is to hold your breath just long enough to fire the shot while maintaining sight alignment and sight picture.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Breathing causes movement of the chest, abdomen and shoulders, which causes the weapon to move while attempting to fire.</li>
      <li>Holding breath too ling can result in increased heart rate, muscle fatigue and eye fatigue reducing shot accuracy.</li>
    </ol>

  </ol>

  <li>Errors in Trigger Control</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The most serious and disrupting error by the shooter is <strong>jerking</strong> - that is, the abrupt application of pressure on the trigger accompanied with muscular action of the hand and arm muscles.</li>
    <li>Another error committed by a shooter when controlling the trigger is <strong>&ldquo;holding too long&rdquo;</strong>, that is the draw out action of pressing the trigger.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="head-1"><p>M9 Holster Drills</p></li>
<p>In order to engage a target quickly from a holster, the shooter must find the shortest and quickest method of getting the fire arm from the holster to the target.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Drawing</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Do NOT attempt to draw fast when first learning the technique. Concentrate on smooth, safe flowing motion.</li>
    <ol type="a">
     <li><strong>Grab</strong>: Firing hand grips pistol while in holster maintaining straight trigger finger.</li>
     <ol>
      <li>Holster grip is grip to shoot with. No time for adjustment after the pistol has been drawn; grip established is the grip you&#8217;re going with.</li>
      <li>Simultaneously, move non-firing hand toward firing side, in front of firing hip.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><strong>Draw</strong>: Lift pistol up until muzzle clears holster.</li>
    <ol>
     <li>Keep trigger finger out of trigger guard.</li>
     <li>Rotate muzzle toward target by dropping string side elbow until muzzle is downrange toward target.</li>
   </ol>
   <li><strong>Smack</strong>: Both hands come together establishing grip, while leaving the non-firing thumb in position to sweep the safety off.</li>
   <ol>
     <li>Thrust weapon forward toward target.</li>
     <li>As front sight approaches center mass on target, sweep safety off with non-firing thumb and place trigger finger on trigger.</li>
   </ol>
   <li><strong>Look and Squeeze</strong>: Shift eye focus from target to front sight.</li>
   <ol>
     <li>Take up slack in trigger.</li>
     <li>Begin trigger squeeze.</li>
   </ol>
 </ol>
</ol>
<li>Holster
  <ol>
    <li>A pistol should be drawn quickly and retuned slowly. To maintain weapons safety, trainee will look at holster to ensure that the weapon is properly secured in holster.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Remove finger from trigger/trigger guard.</li>
        <li>Place de-cocking/safety lever on safe.</li>
        <li>Upon instructor(s) command to holster, holster weapon.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Speed Reload</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Speed reloading is used in imminent danger situations, and when the reload must be accomplished quickly.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Take finger off the trigger and out of the trigger guard; leave the safety OFF.</li>
        <li>Keep weapon out in front of trainee to assist in maintaining proper muzzle control (do not tilt magazine well inboard).</li>
        <li>Using your weak hand, press the magazine release button (with index finger if strong hand is the left hand, or with the thumb if strong hand is the right hand). Allow the magazine to fall to the deck&#47;ground.</li>
        <li>Grasp you &ldquo;Ready&rdquo; magazine or a magazine from your ready pouch, with the thumb and index finger, with index finger straight and along the rounded edge, bring the new magazine up to the magazine well.</li>
        <li>Sow down, to prevent fumbling - insert magazine into magazine well of the receiver, and ensure it is properly seated.</li>
        <li>Re-establish two-handed grip; simulate releasing slide forward while coming back to the point and acquire your target.</li>
      </ol>
  </ol>
  
  <li class="head-1">Components, Functions, and Characteristics of the 500M Shotgun</li>

    </ol>


  </ol>

  <li class="head-1">Guidance on Use of Deadly Force</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity, and when lesser means have been exhausted, are unavailable or cannot be reasonably employed.</li>
    <li>Deadly Force-Conditions:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Self Defense and Defense of Others</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>When deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary against a hostile person(s) to protect law enforcement or security personnel who reasonably believe themselves or others to be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm by the hostile person(s).</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Assets Involving National Security</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>When deadly force reasonably appears necessary to prevent the actual theft or sabotage of assets vital to national security.</li>
        <ol>
          <li>DoD assets shall be specifically designated as &ldquo;vital to national security&rdquo; only when their loss, damage or compromise would seriously jeopardize the fulfillment of a national defense mission.</li>
