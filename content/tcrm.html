<ul><li><span class="list-number">A.</span>Introduction</li><div>We conduct dangerous or risky actions without realizing it. In the Navy, risky behavior can endanger the lives of many.  Operational Risk Management (ORM) is an integral part of the decision-making process for all Navy personnel, on and off duty.  Time Critical Risk Management (TCRM) refers to apply ORM at the point of commencing or during execution of a mission or task.</div><li><span class="list-number">B.</span>Enabling Objective(s):</li><div>DEFINE Time Critical Risk Management (TCRM)</div><div>IDENTIFY terms used with TCRM</div><div>DISCUSS the ABCD Model of TCRM</div><div>EXPLAIN the relationship between the Navy Core Values and Time Critical Risk Management</div><li><span class="list-number">C.</span>Topic Outline</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1.</span>What is Time Critical Risk Management (TCRM)?</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Time Critical Risk Management (TCRM) is using risk management concepts when time and resources are limited.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">(1)</span>The ABCD Model is based on fundamental scientific principles; the ability to focus individuals, increase their situational awareness (SA), and improve their performance in the time critical environment.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">(a)</span>TCRM model consists of graphic representations or icons and the easy to remember mnemonic ABCD.</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">1)</span>A-Assess the situation.</li><li><span class="list-number">2)</span>B-Balance Resources.</li><li><span class="list-number">3)</span>C-Communicate to others.</li><li><span class="list-number">4)</span>D-Do the event and Debrief.</li></ul></ul><li><span class="list-number">(2)</span>TCRM plays a role in improving our chance of completing the task or mission successfully.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">b.</span>The nature of TCRM decisions includes an understanding that:</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">(1)</span>Using the ABCD Model daily creates a habit and trains the brain to continue thinking under stress or duress.
