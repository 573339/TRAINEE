    <strong>Safety is the NUMBER 1 concern at the live fire range</strong>
    <ol type="a">
    <li>General Rangel Safety Rules
      <ol>
<li>Before firing any small arm, inspect the weapon.
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong><u>Safety</strong></u> - Ensure safety is in <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="1"> position.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Magazine</strong></u> - Ensure the magazine <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="2"> is empty.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Chamber</strong></u> - Ensure the chamber is <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="3">.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Safety</strong></u> - Again ensure safety is <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="4">.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Always make sure the bore is free of obstructions.</li>
<li>Never discharge a fire arm while running.</li>
<li>Always be aware of what is <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="5"> the target, and the potential impact zone.</li>
<li>Use only the proper size ammunition. Inspect ammunition to ensure projectiles are properly seated (not loose) in the round casing; the cartridge case is not dented and no corrosion is present.</li>
<li>Never leave weapons loaded and/or unattended, even for a brief period of time.</li>
<li>Never indulge in horseplay when carrying a firearm or while on the firing range.</li>
<li>Weapons shall be clear before any personnel go down range. Weapons or ammunition shall not be handled or manipulated in any way if there is anyone down range.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If any unsafe condition is observed, immediately call &ldquo;Cease Fire&rdquo; or repeat the command if initiated by another shooter. Anyone can call a cease-fire on the range.</li>

    </ol>
    </li>
<li class="head-1">Small Arms Safety on the Firing Range
<ol type="a">
<li>Universal Weapons Safety Rules
  <ol>
<li>Proper weapons handling is the responsibility of the person in control of the weapon. When armed with any weapon where chambering a round has been authorized, personnel must ensure that the safety remains in the safe position until immediately prior to firing.</li>
<li>There are <strong>FOUR</strong> rules that must be observed at all times, whether in training or in combat. These rules are the foundation for responsible weapons handling.
<ol type="a">
<li><strong><u>Rule 1: Treat</strong></u> every weapon as if it were loaded.</li>
<li><strong><u>Rule 2: Never</strong></u> point a weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot.</li>
<li><strong><u>Rule 3: Keep</strong></u> your finger straight and off the trigger until you are ready to fire.</li>
<li><strong><u>Rule 4: Keep</strong></u> weapon on SAFE until you intend to fire.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="head-1">Definitions of &ldquo;Hangfire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Misfire&rdquo;
<ol type="a">
<li>Hangfire -- Delay in the explosion of the charge after the trigger is pulled.</li>
<li><input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="6"> -- Failure of a round to fire after trigger is pulled.</li>
<li>If the weapon fails to fire after the trigger is pulled:
  <ol>
<li>Ensure weapon remains sighted in on your target.</li>
<li>Count to ten.</li>
<li>Keep the weapon level and pointed down range; return to the standing ready position.</li>
<li>Signal for a Training Time Out and wait for assistance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Slide Stop -- After the last round is fired, automatically holds the slide to the rear.</li>
<li>Decocking/Safety Lever -- Used to &ldquo;safe&rdquo; the weapon. When the safety is on, the:
  <ol>
<li>Hammer is released to the forward position.</li>

</li>
<li class="head-1">Weapon Condition Codes
<ol type="a">
<li>Prior to loading the 9mm pistol, the weapon handler should be knowledgeable of weapon-specific condition codes. These codes enable the weapons handler to quickly identify weapon status and clearly convey that information to others.</li>
<li>A weapon&#8217;s readiness to fire and its corresponding safety status are described, by one of four weapon condition codes. The condition codes for the 9mm are as follows:
  <ol>
<li><u>Condition 4</u>: Magazine removed, slide forward, NO round chambered, safety on.</li>
<li><u>Condition 3</u>: Magazine inserted, slide forward, NO round chambered, safety on.</li>
<li><u>Condition 2</u>: Not Applicable.</li>
<li><u>Condition 1</u>: Magazine inserted, slide forward, round chambered, safety on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="head-1">Weapons Commands
<ol type="a">
<li>Weapon commands direct personnel to safely load, unload and employ small arms. The following commands shall be used in weapons handling and on the firing range.
  <ol>
<li>&ldquo;<u>LOAD</u>&rdquo;: This command is used to take a weapon from condition 4 to condition 3.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<u>MADE READY</u>&rdquo;: This command is used to take a weapon from condition 3 to condition 1.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<u>LOAD AND MAKE READY</u>&rdquo;: This is a combined command used to take a weapon from condition 4 to condition 1.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<u>FIRE</u>&rdquo;: This command is used to engage targets.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<u>Holster</u>&rdquo;: A non-verbal command used at RTC Directs a shooter to place the weapon in their holster. Signified by two taps on the shoulder.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<u>Stand-by</u>&rdquo;:  used as a preparatory command indicating the shooter has permission to grip the weapon still in the holster. The weapon will NOT be drawn,</li>
<li>&ldquo;<u>CEASE FIRE</u>&rdquo;: This command is used to cease target engagement.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<u>UNLOAD</u>&rdquo; This command is used to take a weapon from condition 1 or 3, to a condition 4 weapon.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<u>UNLOAD, SHOW CLEAR</u>&rdquo;: This command is used to require a second individual to check the weapon to verify that no ammunition is present before the weapon is put into condition 4.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When showing clear; utilize the four safety steps, verifying each of the following, both physically and visually in sequential order:
  <ol>
<li><u>Safety</u> - Ensure safety is in safe position.</li>
<li><u>Magazine</u> - Ensure magazine is empty.</li>
<li><u>Chamber</u> - Ensure chamber is clear.</li>
<li><u>Safety</u> - Again, ensure safety is on safe.</li>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Personal Protective Equipment:
  <ol>
<li>Small Arms Personal Protection Equipment (PPE)
  <ol type="a">
<li>In addition to following and applying range safety procedures when handling and firing small arms, you should take steps to protect your hearing, particularly when you are exposed to repeated small arms fire, such as on a firing range.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Hearing protection is required at all times when firearms are being discharged during training and qualification.</li>
<li>Approved hearing protection such as sound attenuators that reduce noise levels to 84 decibels or below is required.</li>
<li>There are two general types of ear protective devices:
  <ol type="a">
<li>Ear Plugs (Insert Type)</li>
<li>Circumaural (Mickey Mouse ears)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Blast noise from small arms fire may cause a temporary or permanent hearing loss.
  <ol type="a">
<li>The extend of injury depends on a number of factors, such as:
  <ol>
    <li>Intensity of the noise,</li>
    <li>Length of exposure,</li>
    <li>Your own sensitivity to noise hazards, and</li>
    <li>Type of hearing protection utilized.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When conducting range operations on an indoor range; both types of hearing protection are required due to increased intensity level of noise.</li>
<li>Shatterproof eye protection is required when shooting.
  <ol type="a">
<li>American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved glasses are required.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Once the range has been declared &ldquo;Hot&rdquo; (live fire exercises have commenced) all personnel on the range are required to have safety glasses and hearing protection.
