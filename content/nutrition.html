    <li>Poor nutrition leads to:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Low energy</li>
      <li>Injury and disease</li>
      <li>Could result in early release from the Navy if body fat standards are not continuously met.</li>

  <li class="head-1">Five Fundamental Principles That Assist in Developing a Successful Nutrition Plan</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Eat Clean</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Come back to Earth -- Choose the least processed foods.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>“Whole” foods such as:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Fruits</li>
          <li>Vegetables</li>
          <li>Lean Protein (meat, beans, nuts)</li>
          <li>Low Fat Milk or Yogurt (non-fat or 1%)</li>
          <li>Whole grains that include the word “whole” as the first ingredient on the food label.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Processed foods are those found at most fast food restaurants and in the freezer section of the grocery store.</li>
        <li>They do not resemble the food that came from the ground or the animal. Think of a hot dog.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Eat Color - Eat a variety of fruits or vegetables daily.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Naturally occurring color in food means more nutrients.</li>
        <li>Try to have at least colors at each meal, such as:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Yellow</li>
          <li>Orange</li>
          <li>Green</li>

          <li>White</li>
          <li>Blue/Purple</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Make half your plate fruits, vegetables and grains.</li>
        <li>Artificial color does not count, such as:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Candy</li>
          <li>Food Dye on Icing</li>
        </ol>

    <li>Mindset - The 80/20 Rule</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>The goal is to eat well 80% of the time and enjoy other foods outside these guidelines 20% of the time.</li>

      <li>Enjoy your favorite foods, but eat less.</li>
      <li>Avoid oversize portions.</li>

      <li>Don’t waste your workout.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Eat within 30-60 minutes after exercise to maximize energy stores and start muscle recovery.</li>
        <li>Eating right away prevents extreme hunger and overeating later.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Sleep</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Whenever you can, get 7-9 hours of sleep.</li>
        <li>Chronic lack of sleep increases stress hormones in the body, decreases reaction time and does not allow the body to recover properly.</li>

      <li>Adding different vegetables to a salad.</li>
      <li>Adding fruit to whole grain cereal.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>You must continuously make an effort to ensure you fuel and hydrate your body well.</li>
    <li>Once training is over, the easy choice will be to return to old habits or turn to other foods, such as:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Energy drinks</li>
      <li>Frequent fast foods</li>

<h2>Nutrition Basics for a Healthy Lifestyle</h2>
<i style="color:#e25858">Important facts to remember:</i>


<ol type="1">
  <li class="head-1">Energy Balance Is Key</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Energy in = Food and fluids consumed</li>
    <li>Energy out = Calories burned by the body</li>
    <li>If you take in more calories than you burn, your body stores the extra as fat and you gain weight.</li>
    <li>If you take in fewer calories than you use, your body burns stored calories and you lose weight.</li>
    <li>When energy in equals energy out, body weight is stable.</li>
  </ol>


  <li class="head-1">Energy In – Manage Weight Through Good Food Habits</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Eat a variety of foods every day (Use the ChooseMyPlate.gov).</li>
    <li>Vary the colors in your diet by eating at least 5 servings of fruits & vegetables per day.</li>
    <li>Eat 3 meals a day to distribute calories for better energy utilization. Do not skip breakfast.</li>
    <li>Eat smaller portions of foods.</li>
    <li>Reduce high-sugar foods (sodas, candy, desserts, limit fruit juice).</li>
    <li>Limit high fat foods (fried, mayonnaise or dairy based sauces or dressings).</li>
    <li>Avoid a severe calorie restriction.</li>
    <li>Keep a diet journal when attempting to lose weight.</li>
  </ol>


  <li class="head-1">Energy In – Carbohydrates</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The body uses carbohydrates for immediate energy.</li>
    <li>Carbohydrates (starch/sugars) can comprise up to 50%-65% of calories (5-7 g per kg body weight).</li>
    <li>Food sources include bread, cereal, pasta, rice, beans, fruit, and vegetables.</li>
    <li>Choose whole grains including whole grain breads, legumes, dried beans, fruits, vegetables.</li>
  </ol>


  <li class="head-1">Energy In – Protein</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Necessary for rebuilding and repairing body tissue.</li>
    <li>Approximately 15% of calories should come from protein (0.8-1.4 g per kg body weight).</li>
    <li>Food sources are meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, milk.</li>
    <li>Choose lean sources of protein (non-fried, without skin).</li>
    <li>Protein is used for energy if fat or carbohydrate is lacking in the diet.</li>
    <li>Choose seafood at least twice a week as a main protein food.</li>
  </ol>


  <li class="head-1">Energy In – Fat</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Fat is needed by the body for organ and nerve tissue.</li>
    <li>Fat in the diet carries the vitamins A, D, E, and K to be stored by the liver.</li>
    <li>Fat should be about 25-35% of calories, but only 7% of the calories should come from saturated fat or animal fat (butter, bacon, fried food, baked goods).</li>
    <li>Fat is calorie dense (9 calories/gram), so portions should be small.</li>
    <li>Limit animal sources including cheese, sausages, hot dogs, bacon and butter.</li>
    <li>Choose healthy plant fats including olive or canola oil nuts and seeds.</li>
    <li>Look for seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, trout, tuna, and herring.</li>
    <li>Do not strive for a fat free diet. <ins>Fat is essential. Moderation is the key.</ins></li>
  </ol>


  <li class="head-1">Energy In – Calcium</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Main source is dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese and calcium fortified soymilk). Choose low-fat (1% or less) choices.</li>
    <li>You need at least 3 servings daily (1000+ mg).</li>
    <li>Calcium is good for maintaining strong bones and teeth. If you don’t get enough, bones can weaken – leading to stress fractures, broken bones, etc.</li>
  </ol>


  <li class="head-1">Energy In – Water</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Needed by every cell of the body.</li>
    <li>Drink at least 8 cups of water daily.</li>
    <li>High protein/high sodium diets increase water needs.</li>
    <li>Drink more when increasing fiber intake to prevent constipation.</li>
    <li>Increase fluid intake when exercising a lot to replace sweat losses.</li>
    <li>All beverages except for alcohol, count – choose low calorie for better weight control.</li>
  </ol>


  <li class="head-1">Energy In – How Do Vitamins Fit In?</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Vitamins and minerals do not provide energy – they can help our bodies get energy from the foods we eat.</li>
    <li>Needed to regulate body systems, build/repair tissue, prevent diseases, etc.</li>
    <li>Supplements are not warranted if you are eating a balanced diet with plenty of variety.</li>
    <li>Do your own research before choosing to take any supplement.</li>
  </ol>


  <li class="head-1">Energy Out – Exercise Advantage</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Engage in aerobic exercise 3 – 6 times/week (walk, jog, cycle, etc.).</li>
    <li>Engage in strength training exercise 2 – 3 times/week.</li>
    <li>Increase lifestyle physical activity (taking stairs, parking far away).</li>
  </ol>


  <li class="head-1">Energy Out – Exercise (FITT Rule)</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Frequency: Almost every day</li>
    <li>Intensity: The higher the intensity, the more calories you burn in a given time period. Work hard enough to get your heart rate up but still be able to carry on a little conversation.</li>
    <li>Time: 30 to 60 minutes</li>
    <li>Type: Aerobic and strength</li>
  </ol>

  <li class="head-1">Energy Out – Plan Ahead</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Plan your daily schedule so that exercise is a regular part of the routine.</li>
    <li>Exercise burns calories and helps to manage stress.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

  <div class="col-xs-9 col-sm-9 col-md-9 col-lg-9 food-qa">
    <h4>What foods are in the grain group?</h4>
    <p>Any food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley or another cereal grain is a grain product. Bread, pasta, oatmeal, breakfast cereals, tortillas, and grits are examples of grain products.</p>
    <p>Grains are divided into 2 subgroups, <strong>whole grains and refined grains.</strong></p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class=" row section1">
  <div class="col-xs-5 col-sm-5 col-md-5 col-lg-5">
    <p>Whole grains contain the entire grain kernel -- the bran, germ, and endosperm. Examples include:</p>
    <ul class="grain-list">
      <li>Whole-Wheat Flour</li>
      <li>Whole Cornmeal</li>
      <li>Bulgur (Cracked Wheat)</li>
      <li>Brown Rice</li>
      <li>Oatmeal</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-7 col-sm-7 col-md-7 col-lg-7">
    <p>Refined grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ. This is done to give grains a finer texture and improve their shelf life, but it also removes dietary fiber, iron, and many B vitamins. Some examples of refined grain products are:</p>
    <ul class="grain-list">
      <li>White Flour</li>
      <li>White Rice</li>
      <li>Degermed Cornmeal</li>
      <li>White Bread</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="section">Most refined grains are enriched. This means certain B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid) and iron are added back after processing. Fiber is not added back to enriched grains. Check the ingredient list on refined grain products to make sure that the word “enriched” is included in the grain name. Some food products are made from mixtures of whole grains and refined grains.</p>

    <h5><sup>*</sup>Selection Tips</h5>
    <p class="section1">Choose fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese. If you choose milk or yogurt that is not fat-free, or cheese that is not low-fat, the fat in the product counts against your maximum limit for "empty calories" (calories from solid fats and added sugars).</p>
    <p class="section1">If sweetened milk products are chosen (flavored milk, yogurt, drinkable yogurt, desserts), the added sugars also count against your maximum limit for "empty calories" (calories from solid fats and added sugars).</p>
    <p class="section1">For those who are lactose intolerant, smaller portions (such as 4 fluid ounces of milk) may be well tolerated. Lactose-free and lower-lactose products are available. These include lactose-reduced or lactose-free milk, yogurt, and cheese, and calcium-fortified soymilk (soy beverage). Also, enzyme preparations can be added to milk to lower the lactose content. Calcium-fortified foods and beverages such as cereals, orange juice, or rice or almond beverages may provide calcium, but may not provide the other nutrients found in dairy products.</p>
    <blockquote><strong>Key:</strong> Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk.</blockquote>

      <h4>What foods are included in the protein group?</h4>
      <p>All foods made from meat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts, and seeds are considered part of the Protein Foods Group. Beans and peas are also part of the Vegetable Group. For more information on beans and peas, see Beans and Peas Are Unique Foods.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Select a variety of protein foods to improve nutrient intake and health benefits, including at least 8 ounces of cooked seafood per week. Young children need less, depending on their age and calories needs. The advice to consume seafood does not apply to vegetarians. Vegetarian options in the Protein Foods Group include beans and peas, processed soy products, and nuts and seeds. Meat and poultry choices should be lean or low-fat.</p>

  <h5><sup>*</sup>Selection Tips</h5>
  <p class="section1">Choose lean or low-fat meat and poultry. If higher fat choices are made, such as regular ground beef (75 to 80% lean) or chicken with skin, the fat counts against your maximum limit for empty calories (calories from solid fats or added sugars).</p>
  <p class="section1">If solid fat is added in cooking, such as frying chicken in shortening or frying eggs in butter or stick margarine, this also counts against your maximum limit for empty calories (calories from solid fats and added sugars).</p>
  <p class="section1">Select some seafood that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, trout, sardines, anchovies, herring, Pacific oysters, and Atlantic and Pacific mackerel.</p>
  <p class="section1">Processed meats such as ham, sausage, frankfurters, and luncheon or deli meats have added sodium. Check the Nutrition Facts label to help limit sodium intake. Fresh chicken, turkey, and pork that have been enhanced with a salt-containing solution also have added sodium. Check the product label for statements such as “self-basting” or “contains up to __% of __”, which mean that a sodium-containing solution has been added to the product.</p>
  <p>Choose unsalted nuts and seeds to keep sodium intake low.</p>
