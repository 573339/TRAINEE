Others have supporting roles, such as repairs salvage and delivery of supplies. The Naval Reserve forces also completely and independently maintain and operate many surface combatant ships.

                <li>The cruiser as a “named” ship, vice mission, evolved when the world’s navies phased out sail propulsion ships with wooden hulls, creating armored, steel “battleships”.</li>
