    <li class="head-1">Purpose and Responsibilities of Watchstanding</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Navy personnel are assigned duty as watchstanders to perform many jobs in port and at sea.</li>
      <li>Most watch assignments last four hours.</li>
      <li>Watchstanders serve many vital functions:</li>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Provide security to prevent:</li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Sabotage</li>
          <li>Damage to property</li>
          <li>Theft</li>
          <li>Unauthorized personnel entering a restricted area</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Ensure the safety of personnel and equipment; e.g., check for fire, flooding, and machinery problems.</li>
        <li>Provide an important role in fulfilling the Navy's mission.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>A watchstander has many responsibilities.</li>
      <ol class="1">
        <li>For new watchstanders, apply yourself to training on the requirements of the watch using the Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS) program.</li>
        <li>Report to your watchstation 30 minutes before assigned watch time.</li>
        <ol class="a">
          <li>Use the first 15 minutes to perform a turnover before assuming the watch.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Use customary Navy terminology when writing reports and talking to others.</li>
        <li>Answer the telephone using proper procedures and DO NOT discuss classified information unless on a secure line.</li>
        <li>Take appropriate action for any emergency; e.g., fire, flooding, or bomb threat.</li>
        <li>Remain at your watch station until properly relieved.</li>
        <li>Follow all legal orders.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <li class="head-1">Types of Orders</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>General orders</li>
    <ol class="1">
      <li>The purpose is to cover routine and foreseeable situations.</li>
      <li>Same for all watchstanders and they never change.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Special orders</li>
    <ol class="1">
      <li>Cover a certain time or situation.</li>
      <li>Cover specifics of a particular post.</li>
      <li>May be written or verbal.</li>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>Written orders</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Remain in effect until canceled or changed.</li>
          <li>Are called "Standing Orders."</li>
          <li>Are normally kept in a pass down log for each watch station. Read the log before assuming the watch.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Verbal orders</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Come from a higher authority; e.g., CDO, OOD, etc.</li>
          <li>Usually cover a situation of very short duration.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li class="head-1">Consequences of Improper Watchstanding</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Improper watchstanding for any reason is inexcusable.</li>
    <li>You will be held accountable for violations of any rule or regulation that governs your watch.</li>
    <li>Improper watchstanding could result in:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Non-judicial punishment under one of the following UCMJ Articles (or others):</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Art. 78 -- <i>Accessory After the Fact.</i></li>
        <li>Art. 92 -- <i>Failure to Obey Order or Regulation.</i></li>
        <li>Art. 107 -- <i>False Official Statement.</i></li>
        <li>Art. 113 -- <i>Misbehavior of a Sentinel or Lookout.</i></li>
      </ol>
      <li>Reduced chance of advancement due to lower performance marks on your periodic evaluation.</li>
      <li>Disqualification from the watch, requiring more intense training and re-qualification.</li>
      <li>Counseling (formal or informal).</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li class="head-1">Purpose of the Official Watch Log</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The Official Watch Log is a complete chronological log maintained to ensure an accurate permanent record of the command's activities.</li>
    <li>Used to record every circumstance of importance or interest, which concerns the crew, and the operation and the safety of the ship or station.</li>
    <li>Can be used as evidence before courts and other legal bodies.</li>  
  </ol>
  <li class="head-1">Procedures For Making Log Entries</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>When making log entries, use a ballpoint pen containing black ink.</li>
    <li>Make entries in capital block letters.</li>
    <li>All entries must be complete and accurate, and written in standard Navy language.</li>
    <li>Procedures to correct errors.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>There are to be no erasures.</li>
      <li>Draw a single line through the mistake, horizontally, so that it remains legible.</li>
      <li>Initial the mistake in the left hand margin of the page.</li>
      <li>Continue the entry correctly</li>
      <li>The watchstander who signs the log is the only person authorized to make corrections, additions, or changes to the log.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Making a log entry for assuming/relieving the watch.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>The first line after the heading should relate to assuming the watch.</li>
      <li>Upon completion of the watch, write on the last line "Properly relieved by" (oncoming watches name).</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Sign your name on the next line.</li>
        <li>Print your name under your signature.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Making late entries.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>There are times when events occur too quickly for the watchstander to make entries in the log.</li>
      <li>To insert the entry when there is time would cause the log to lose its chronological sequence.</li>
      <li>Steps for recording late entries:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>In the left margin corresponding to where the entry should have been, place an asterisk (*).</li>
        <li>Enter the "late entry" on the next available line and place another asterisk (*) in the left margin.</li>
        <li>Put the original time the event took place followed by the information.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Ending a page</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Frequently, the end of a 24-hour day will not be at the bottom of a log page.</li>
      <li>From the bottom right of the last line of information, draw a diagonal line to the lower left corner of the page.</li>
      <li>Print on the diagonal line "NO FURTHER ENTRIES THIS PAGE" and initial the entry.</li>
