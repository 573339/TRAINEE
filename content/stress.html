Deep muscle relaxation reduces the muscle tension as well as general mental anxiety.  Typically, it involves tensing individual muscle groups for several seconds and releasing the tension, allowing the muscles too gradually relax.  Deep muscle relaxation is effective in combating stress related health problems and often helps people get to sleep.</li><li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Physical Activity</li><li><span class="list-number">d.</span>Other good stress-reducing activities:</li><li><span class="list-number">e.</span>Practice time management techniques.</li><li><span class="list-number">f.</span>Keep a journal: write notes to remind you of what you need to do and when.</li><li><span class="list-number">g.</span>Play a musical instrument.</li></ul><li><span class="list-number">5.</span>Where to get Help:</li><ul><li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Resources available to you and your shipmates when assistance is needed.
