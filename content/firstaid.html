  <li class="head-1">Definition of First Aid</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>First aid is emergency care of the sick or injured.</li>
  </ol>
  <li class="head-1">Provides only temporary assistance or treatment until medical help is available.</li>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>Purposes of First Aid</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Save life.</li>
      <li>Prevent further injury. When assisting an injured person, you must know what to do and what not to do.</li>
      <li>Prevent or minimize infection.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Primary objectives are to maintain:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Airway</li>
      <li>Breathing</li>
      <li>Circulation</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <li class="head-1">General Rules of First Aid -- Specific injuries requiring first aid vary; but, in most cases, the general rules apply.</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Remain calm.</li>
    <li>Shout “HELP” and send for medical help immediately.</li>
    <li>Examine the entire body.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Remove only enough clothing to determine the extent of the injury.</li>
      <li>Ensure the person does NOT become chilled.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Be confident and reassuring. It is important to keep the patient as calm as possible.</li>
    <li>Keep the victim lying down. The head should be level with body lying down EXCEPT when the victim:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Is <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="1"> or bleeding about the mouth. Turn head to side to prevent aspiration (the inhalation of blood, vomit, or water into the lungs).</li>
      <li>Has shortness of breath. Place in sitting or semi-sitting position to make breathing easier.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Prevent further injury by not moving the victim unless necessary.</li>
    <li>Keep the victim comfortably warm to alleviate or reduce shock.</li>
    <li>Do NOT allow the patient to see the injury. This could increase shock.</li>
    <li>Do <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="2"> touch open wounds or burns with fingers or objects, unless necessary; e.g., to stop severe bleeding.</li>
    <li>Do NOT give an unconscious person anything by mouth to prevent choking or aspiration.</li>
    <li>Use extreme care and caution when treating a suspected fracture.</li>
     <ol type="1">
      <li>Before moving the victim <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="3"> broken or suspected broken bones.</li>
      <li>Do NOT attempt to set fractures (broken bones); this may cause further injury.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Secure victim onto stretcher and transport the victim with feet <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="4"> down ladders and head first up ladders. The person at the head observes the victim’s breathing. A victim can be transported on any of the following stretchers:</li>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Stokes stretcher -- Used to transfer victims from boats or ships.</li>
      <li>Miller board -- Used to vertically move victims.</li>
      <li>Spine board used to immobilize victims with possible spinal injury.</li>
      <li>Reeves Sleeve -- Used to immobilize and transport victims horizontally or vertically through confined spaces (narrow passageways, escape trunks).</li>
      <li>Army litter–-Used for transporting battle casualties.</li>
    </ol>

      <li>Maintain breathing</li>
      <li>Stop bleeding</li>
      <li>Prevent or Reduce Shock</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Maintain Breathing (for choking victim)</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Conscious Victim</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Symptoms</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Person will clutch their throat. This is the universal distress signal.</li>
          <li>With total airway obstruction, the victim cannot speak, cough, or breathe.</li>
          <li>With partial airway obstruction, the victim might be having difficulties breathing or speaking.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Treatment</li>
         <ol type="1">
          <li>Ask the victim, "Are you choking?" and "Are you pregnant?"; then tell them you can help.</li>
          <li>Perform Heimlich maneuver, if necessary.</li>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Stand behind the person; place a foot between the victim’s feet for control in case the victim becomes unconscious.</li>
            <li>Wrap arms around person's waist.</li>
            <li>Make a fist, place thumb side against the abdomen and slightly above the navel.</li>
            <li>Grasp the fist with your other hand.</li>
            <li>Press fist into the person's abdomen with an inward and upward thrust.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>If the victim is pregnant or obese, perform a chest thrust.</li>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Before administering the <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="5"> <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="6"> , check for charms or medallions.</li>
            <li>Performed same as abdominal thrust with the following exceptions:</li>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Arms are brought through the person's armpit just under the breast.</li>
              <li>Give a quick backwards thrust.</li>
            </ol>
          </ol>
          <li>Repeat the Heimlich maneuver or chest thrust until the obstruction is clear.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li>Unconscious Victim (treatment)</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Place victim on their back.</li>

          <li>To dislodge any foreign object, use a hooking motion with your index finger from the base of the victim's tongue along the inside of the cheek.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Open the victim’s <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="7"> <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="8"> .</li>
         <ol type="1">
          <li>Place your hand on victim’s forehead.</li>
          <li>Place fingers of your other hand under the bony part of victim’s chin. (Do not put pressure under chin).</li>
          <li>Tilt victim’s head and lift jaw (do not close their mouth).</li>
          <li>Place your ear over victim’s mouth and nose.</li>
          <li>Look at the chest; listen and feel for breathing for 3-5 seconds.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>If the victim is not breathing, say, “Not breathing” so someone will get help, then give breaths.</li>
         <ol type="1">
          <li>Pinch nose.</li>
          <li>Open your mouth.</li>
          <li>Take a deep breath.</li>
          <li>Make an airtight seal around the victim’s mouth.</li>

        </ol>
        <li>If unsuccessful, perform <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="9"> thrusts.</li>
         <ol type="1">
          <li>Straddle victim’s thighs.</li>
          <li>Place heel of one hand slightly above the navel and below tip of breastbone.</li>
          <li>Place the other hand directly on top (interlock fingers) and push into person’s abdomen with quick upward thrusts 6 to 10 times.</li>
          <li>Continue sequence until person breathes, you are exhausted, another trained individual relieves you, or medical assistance arrives.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li>Self-help -- If you are alone and the victim of an airway obstruction, perform one of the following steps:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Using your own fist, perform the abdominal thrust maneuver.</li>
        <li>Use the back of a chair (with a rounded edge) or similar structure to exert abdominal pressure.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Stop Bleeding</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Definition: Bleeding is any break in the wall of one or more blood vessels. May be internal or external.</li>
      <li>Types of Bleeding</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>Arterial:</strong> Bleeding from an artery, Blood is bright <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="10"> in appearance and spurts from the wound.</li>
        <li><strong>Venous:</strong> Bleeding from the veins. Blood is dark red or maroon in appearance and flows steadily from the wound.</li>
        <li><strong>Capillary:</strong> Bleeding from capillaries. The blood is bright red/maroon and oozes from the wound.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Methods for Controlling Bleeding</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Direct Pressure: Application of pressure directly on the wound.</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Place a dressing firmly over the wound.</li>
          <li>If bleeding does not stop, secure another dressing over the first.</li>
          <li>If possible, use sterile or clean dressings; but if not available, improvise with clean clothing or other materials.</li>
          <li>After the dressing has been applied, use the heel of your hand to apply pressure directly on top of the wound.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Elevation: Elevate or raise the injured area above the level of the heart.</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Used with <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="11"> pressure.</li>
          <li>Use a stable object to maintain elevation.</li>
          <li>Do NOT elevate a limb if a fracture is suspected.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Indirect Pressure (Pressure Points): Application of pressure where a main artery lies near the skin surface and over a bone or firm tissue.</li>
         <ol type="1">
          <li>Use with direct pressure and elevation to control bleeding without using a tourniquet.</li>
          <li>The compress is to compress the artery against the underlying firm surface, thus slowing the flow of the blood to the wound.</li>
          <li>Used in conjunction with direct pressure and elevation to control bleeding without having to use a tourniquet.</li>
          <li>Pressure points in the arms and the groin are used most often.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="12"> : Used ONLY as a last resort for severe, life-threatening bleeding that cannot be controlled by any other method.</li>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>A tourniquet is dangerous; its application may cause tissue injury or loss of the injured limb.</li>
          <li>Used only in cases of partial or complete severing of arms, legs, or when bleeding is uncontrollable.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Prevent or Reduce Shock</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Shock is a condition in which blood circulation is seriously disturbed; results in a lack of oxygen to the body.</li>
      <li>All injuries are accompanied by some degree of shock.Symptoms</li>
      <li>Symptoms</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Eyes: Vacant (no movement), lackluster (dull), dilated (large) pupils.</li>
        <li>Breathing: Shallow, irregular, and rapid.</li>
        <li>Skin: Pale, cold, and moist.</li>
        <li>Pulse: Usually rapid but may be weak or absent.</li>
        <li>May complain of nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, weakness, and anxiety.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Treatment</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Monitor the airway, <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="13"> , and circulation.</li>
        <li>Control bleeding as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Keep victim lying down with legs elevated 6 to 12 inches. Do NOT elevate legs if you suspect:</li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Head or spinal injuries.</li>
          <li>An injured hip or leg.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>If vomiting, place person on side.</li>
        <li>Keep victim warm; maintain warm body temperature.</li>
        <li>If the victim has difficulty breathing, help into a sitting or semi-sitting position.</li>
        <li>Do NOT give anything by mouth.</li>
        <li>Reassure the person.</li>
        <li>Seek medical assistance as soon as possible.</li>

  <li class="head-1">Characteristics and Proper Treatment of Skin Wounds</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Types</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Incision: Edges are smooth with little damage to surrounding skin. Caused by a sharp cutting instrument such as a knife, razor, or broken glass.</li>
      <li>Laceration: Skin is <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="14"> rather than cut. Caused by blunt force such as a tire iron or baseball bat.</li>
      <li>Puncture: Skin is pierced by a pointed object, such as a bullet, nail, or knife.</li>
      <li>Abrasion: Skin is rubbed or scraped off.</li>
      <li>Avulsion: Skin is torn loose or left hanging as a flap. Caused by an accident involving machinery such as lawn mowers and power tools.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Treatment -- If the wound is fresh:</li>
    <ol type="1">

  </ol>
  <li class="head-1">Types and Proper Treatment of Burns and Scalds</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Burns and scalds are caused by exposure to intense heat.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Dry heat is a burn.</li>
      <li>Moist heat is a scald.</li>
    </ol>

      <li>First-degree: Minor redness, mild pain and swelling, increased warmth.</li>
      <li>Second-degree: Skin is red, mottled (different colors), and blistered. Swelling occurs as time passes. The burn is moist due to loss of fluids through the damaged skin. Victim suffers severe pain.</li>
      <li>Third-degree: destruction of nerve endings. May appear charred or white. Severe pain at burn edges but not at burn site.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Treatment</li>

      <li>Remove jewelry from the victim except, when because of the injury, it is not possible.</li>
      <li>To relieve pain apply cold compresses to the affected area or submerge in cold water.</li>
      <li>To prevent complications, do NOT:</li>
      <ol type="a">

  <li class="head-1">Definition of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Training and the Importance of Receiving Training</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>CPR is a first aid procedure that consists of external heart compression and artificial ventilation for a victim that is in cardiac and respiratory arrest; i.e., the victim’s heart and breathing have stopped.</li>
    <li>The external compression of the heart provides blood circulation to the organs and tissues of the body.</li>
    <li>Victims having life-threatening accidents depend on others to save their lives. The following conditions may cause respiratory and cardiac arrest:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Heart attack</li>
      <li>Electrical shock</li>
      <li>Drowning and suffocation</li>
      <li>Gas <input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="25"> .</li>
      <li>Overdose of drugs and/or alcohol</li>
    </ol>
    <li>This lesson will <strong>NOT</strong> qualify you to perform CPR. <strong>NEVER</strong> attempt CPR procedures unless you have received proper training.</li>
    <li>If you are NOT CPR qualified, the victim could:</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Die due to the lack of qualified medical assistance.</li>
      <li>Suffer more injury due to incorrect procedures.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>To learn CPR, take an approved course from a qualified instructor.</li>
  </ol>
  <li class="head-1">Relationship between the Navy Core Values and Performing First Aid</li>
  <ol type="1">
    <li><strong>Honor:</strong> Display a code of ethics, integrity and concern for those injured.</li>
    <li><strong>Courage:</strong> Have the courage to assist and administer aid, regardless of the severity of the injury.</li>
    <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Be committed to performing first aid to the best of your ability.</li>
