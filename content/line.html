       <h2>A. Introduction</h2>
     <p>In this laboratory, you will learn two basic knots that will commonly be used during your Navy career. You will be preparing a heaving line to throw from the ship to a pier, or from a pier back to the ship. You will be preparing a mooring line for use by coiling, faking, and flemishing. Tis lesson discusses the procedures for securing for sea, and the safety precautions to be followed when securing equipment. In addition, you will learn the procedures to break out, don, connect, test, operate, and secure a sound-powered telephone.</p>
