Regardless of how you choose to report sexual assault, you will be offered a full range of advocacy, medical and counseling services. Remember, if you initially make a restricted report, you can change it to an unrestricted report at a later date.  However, if you initially make an unrestricted report, it cannot be changed to a restricted report.  If you do not initially select the most suitable reporting option, it may result in you having less control over the release of your personal information.</li></ul></ul>
