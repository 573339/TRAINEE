  <p>Before coming on active duty, you may not have given much thought to arranging your legal and financial affairs. The following contains suggestions, which may make your period of military service run more smoothly.</p>

  <p>Legal Assistance attorneys can assist you and your dependents with civil legal matters, at no cost to you. They can provide powers of attorney, write wills, notarize documents; review contracts and leases, and provide advice on many areas of law. They cannot, however, represent you in civilian court. If you need to go to court, they will refer you to a civilian attorney through a local bar association.</p>

  <p>If you have questions or need assistance in any of the areas discussed, contact the Legal Assistance Office. The Legal Assistance Office will be located at the Naval Legal Service Office at your base. If there is none available, contact a Staff Judge Advocate or ask your LPO about the location of the nearest military attorney.</p>

  <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Legal Residence:</ins> Your legal residence (also called “domicile”) is the place that you consider your true, fixed, and permanent home. It is the place you intend to return to after separating or retiring from the military. It is possible to change your legal residence during your time in the military; this can affect how you vote, pay taxes, register your vehicle, and other legal processes so it’s best to consult a Legal Assistance Attorney before you do so. Also note that your legal residence is a separate term than your “home of record”, or the place where you joined the military. Normally they are the same, but it is possible for them to be different.</p>

  <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Voting:</ins> If you were not registered to vote when you left your home state and wish to register now, contact your command Voting Assistance Officer. If you are already registered to vote and now live outside your home state, you may vote an absentee ballot. Your command Voting Assistance Officer can help.</p>

  <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Debts:</ins> There is no law that wipes out your previous debts just because you came on active duty. You are still required to pay them. You are also responsible for the joint debts of you and your spouse if your name is on the debt, even if they are the only one using the account. Under the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act, you may be able to reduce the interest rate on some of the debts you had before coming on active duty to 6%. If you need help working out a budget, the Legal Assistance Office can help.</p>

  <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Income Tax:</ins> You are not excused from paying federal and state income taxes because of military service; though there are some states that do not tax the military pay of their residents. You can get help filling out your income tax returns through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program on base at the Family Service Center. You can have your returns filed electronically and decrease the waiting time for your refund. A Legal Assistance Attorney can answer specific tax questions.</p>

  <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Property Tax:</ins> You must pay property tax on your possessions in the state of your legal residence, if it is required by the state. The state in which you live in only because of military service is prohibited under the Service member’s Civil Relief Act from taxing your property. You cannot be taxed by two states.</p>

  <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Housing:</ins> If you are going to buy a house, bring the contract to the Legal Assistance office to have it reviewed before you sign it. If you are going to rent, make sure your lease has a military clause that allows you to break the lease without penalty if you are required to move before the lease is finished. Military clauses vary greatly, so it pays to have your clause reviewed by a Legal Assistance Attorney. Do not assume it will cover you in every situation in which you might have to break your lease. For instance, most military clauses do not allow you to break your lease to move into military housing. Once you sign the lease, you may be stuck with it.</p>

  <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Insurance:</ins> You may want to cancel some of your existing insurance policies if the military will provide you with the same or better insurance. You should never cancel any insurance without knowing what the military will provide you, and whether you can renew your civilian insurance when you leave the military.
    <p>The military will provide, or pay for, much of your family’s medical care, and for some dental care. It may not pay for all that your family will require. You may want to consider a supplemental policy to cover the remainder of the costs.</p>

    <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">SGLI:</ins> Low cost life insurance is available through Servicemen’s Group Life Insurance (SGLI) and can be paid for through payroll deduction. As a young sailor, your life insurance policy may be your largest asset. You should never write “by law” when stating who you want to receive your SGLI proceeds; you should name specific beneficiaries; “by law” designation is not authorized for naval personnel. If you also buy private life insurance, make sure the policy will still pay off if you die while in the military; some may not.</p>

    <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Other Contracts:</ins> If it looks too good to be true, it probably is! If you have questions about a contract for something you are buying, bring it to a Legal Assistance Attorney before you sign it. In very few cases, you may be allowed to cancel a contract within three days after signing it; but these are rare. And if something is promised but is not in writing, assume the promise never happened and that the seller will not make good on the promise.</p>

    <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Powers of Attorney:</ins> A Special Power of Attorney is a document that allows someone else to legally act for you on your behalf for a specific purpose. Examples of a Special Power of Attorney is to allow someone to sell your car, access your bank account, ship your household goods, and bring a child to medical care. If you need someone else to legally act on your behalf, you should see a Legal Assistance Attorney to determine what type of power of attorney you need. They can be written to fulfill almost any need.</p>
    <p>A General Power of Attorney allows someone complete control over your affairs. You should see a Legal Assistance Attorney first since these have far-reaching consequences and are rarely necessary.</p>

    <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Family Money Matters:</ins> If your military duties will frequently keep you away from your family, and in many cases they will, consider setting up joint bank accounts, or obtaining a credit card to be used by your spouse when you are away. Remember, however, that they will have access to your finances just as you do.</p>

    <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Wills and Living Wills:</ins> If you die without a will your state will determine who inherits your assets; it might not be who you want. A will allows you to designate your beneficiaries and name guardians for your children, two very important things. You may also want a living will. This is a document that lets you state that if you have a terminal condition; you do not want to be kept alive artificially. It also allows you to name someone to make medical decisions for you if you cannot speak for yourself. A Legal Assistance Attorney can discuss your situation with you and prepare these documents, if you want.</p>

    <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Household Goods Inventory:</ins> You should make a list of all your household goods in case they are lost or destroyed in a military move. This happens more often than you may think. This list will be a big help in being reimbursed. The list should include brand names, serial numbers, original cost, and date acquired. You may also want to take some photos or a videotape of your possessions.</p>

    <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Family Care Plan:</ins> If you are a single parent, a dual-service couple with dependents, or solely responsible for the care of another person, you are required to have a Family Care Plan. This document designates who will care for children in the event you (or you and your spouse) are required to deploy. A Legal Assistance Attorney can discuss your situation with you.</p>

    <p><ins style="color:#e25858;">Paternity:</ins> The Navy expects you to support your children, including those born out of wedlock which you acknowledge are yours or a court determines are yours. If you do support your children, you are eligible for more pay and can have the children enrolled in the military health care system. If you have questions about whether you are the father of a child born out of wedlock, or about the consequences of admitting paternity, see a Legal Assistance Attorney.</p>
