       <h2>A. Introduction</h2>
     <p>This lesson provides the basic information about lines and wire ropes that you will need for the basic seamanship laboratories. During your Navy career, you will be working or riding in small boats. This lesson discusses the types of small boats used by the Navy and the safety precautions for small boat passengers. In addition, this lesson will also teach you about sound-powered telephones. They are one of the most commonly used communication devices aboard ship.</p>
     <br />
     <p>The following Naval Standards will be touched on in this lesson: B276, G034, G035, G 036, G292, I310, I320. NAVPERS 18068F, Naval Standards for E1 through E3 may be found in the Recruit Trainee Guide</p>
