<p>Meaning:  We are directed by the Navy to provide the Fleet with sailors able to do their jobs free from tooth pain and the potential of dental emergencies, which can lead to a lack of mission accomplishment for the Navy.  We take pride in our commitment to provide you, the Navy&rsquo;s finest, with the best quality dental care.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Our commitment to you will begin on your P-2 day of training (DOT) at Bldg. 1523 (Recruit In-processing).
    <ol>
      <li>Your Dental record will be constructed.</li>
      <li>X-rays will be taken to aid in determining what treatment you will require in basic training.</li>
      <li>Health promotion presentations will be available while you are in Dental.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>We understand the concerns of patients seeing a dentist for the first time.  All patents will be treated with the same respect.  If you are having a Dental problem while in basic training (toothache, trauma, or swelling), please be aware there is a Duty Dental Officer is available 24 hours a day to handle any Dental emergency.  Inform your Recruit Division Commander that you are having a problem and they will arrange to have you seen and get the problem corrected.</li>

  <li>On your P-4 DOT at Bldg. 1523, you will receive a detailed Dental exam.
    <ol>
      <li>A treatment plan will be provided to correspond to your Dental needs.</li>
      <li>Patients identified as having a large number of cavities or unhealthy gums will be given special care during their tour at Great Lakes.</li>
      <li>Some patients may receive Dental treatment on their P-4 DOT.</li>
      <li>If you do not understand what care is going to be provided, please ask a staff member-we are here to help you.  The more you understand about your dental care needs, the better you can take care of your oral health.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>You will begin to receive Dental care on your 1-5 DOT at Bldg. 1017 (USS OSBORNE), including fillings, cleanings, and wisdom teeth evaluations.
    <ol>
      <li>Those patients requiring additional care will be given appointments during recruit training.</li>
      <li>Every effort will be made to complete all your urgent care at RTC. </li>
      <li>Your cooperation in keeping your appointments is essential.  Failed appointments not only hurt you, but also your fellow shipmates.  Keeping your appointment shows us your belief in the Navy Core Value of Commitment.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Things you can do to help maintain your Dental health while in basic training:
    <ol>
      <li>Brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste three times a day.  If you can only brush once a day, rinse your mouth with water after meals and brush just before bed.  Why before bed?  Then you are sleeping, the saliva (spit) in your mouth slows down and the protective &ldquo;bathing&rdquo; effect of saliva is reduced.  Food remaining on your teeth can result in an increase of the cavity process.  If you brush before going to bed, your reduced salivary flow will allow the fluoride in the toothpaste to remain in contact with the teeth for a longer period and stop or slow the cavity process.</li>
      <li>Floss your teeth at least once a day to remove the food and debris between your teeth.  Leaving any material on a tooth surface for greater than a 24 hour period increases the risk of having this material become hardened (tarter/calculus).  Once hardened it can only be removed by a Dental professional.  You only floss the teeth you want to keep.  Lack of flossing can lead to gum disease-the number one reason for tooth loss in adults.</li>
      <li>Pay attention to the things you eat during and after initial training.  Some sodas, fruit drinks, desserts and snacks contain acids and up to 12 spoons of sugar.  Your teeth are attacked for up to 20 minutes after consuming these items and your risk for developing tooth decay greatly increases.  Limit between meal snacking and become informed about the acid and sugar content of the things you eat.  Try eating fruits or vegetables for snacks.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Following graduation, your Dental care will continue.      </li>
    <ol>
      <li>Treatment not completed at Recruit Training Command will be continued at your next duty station.
      <li>Each year, you will be given a Dental exam to determine your Dental needs and make you aware of your progress in maintaining Dental health.</li>
      <li>Those graduating Sailors desiring to remain tobacco free can obtain assistance from Dental (688-3331), the TSC Wellness Center (688-2617) or any medical or dental facility at the base where you are sent.</li>
      <li>Following graduation, Sailors with dependents can take advantage of the TRICARE Active Duty Family Member Dental Plan by calling Dental (688-3620) or contacting United Concordia (1-800-866-8499).  The benefits offered by the program are excellent and the rates are very reasonable.</li>
