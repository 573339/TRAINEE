	<h2>A. TEST TOPIC INTRO</h2>
	<p>During your Navy career, you will encounter many different types of ships and aircraft. The types of ships and aircraft have evolved to meet the challenge of changing warfare and doctrine. This lesson is an introduction to a brief history and overview of the US Navy ships and aircraft mission and weapon systems. The following Naval Standards will be touched on in this lesson: H038, H239. NAVPERS 18068F, Naval Standards for E1 through E3 may be found in the Recruit Trainee Guide.</p>

		<li>Mission--Varies with the type of combatant ship. Some engage primarily in combat with enemy forces, such as carriers, cruisers, frigates and submarines. Others have supporting roles, such as repairs salvage and delivery of supplies. The Naval Reserve forces also completely and independently maintain and operate many surface combatant ships. Their missions are the same as their active duty counterpart.</li>

				<li>History</li>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Nov. 14, 1910, Eugene Ely, a civilian pilot took off from a wooden platform built over the bow of the light cruiser USS Birmingham</li>
					<li>March 20, 1922, the <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#uss">USS Langley (CV-1)</a> converted from the collier USS Jupiter (AC-3) was commissioned as the Navy’s first aircraft carrier.</li>
					<li>June 4, 1934, the <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ranger">USS Ranger (CV-4)</a>, was commission as the first ship designed and built from the keel up as an aircraft carrier.</li>
					<li>WWII saw the utility, diversity and speed of the aircraft carrier become the backbone of Navy Task Forces, replacing the Battleship.</li>
					<li>The US Navy presently only has Nuclear Powered carriers (CVN) in commission.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>Mission-Carry, launch, and retrieve aircraft at sea.</li>
				<li>Weapons-Primary weapons system are the aircraft. Other offensive and defensive weapons include; Sea Sparrow, Phalanx CIWS, and Torpedo Counter Measures.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Cruisers (CG)</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>History</li>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>The word “Cruiser” was first used by the English in 1651.</li>
					<li>By 1694, the term was used for ships detached from the main fleet to “cruise” and protect the harbor.</li>
					<li>The cruiser as a “named” ship, vice mission, evolved when the world’s navies phased out sail propulsion ships with wooden hulls, creating armored, steel “battleships”.</li>
					<li>With the emergence of naval strategy using the large battleship, the need arose for a middle-size combatant—the cruiser</li>
