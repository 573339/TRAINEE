<p>Welcome aboard!  These words carry a world of significance.  They mean that you have made one of the biggest decisions a young person can -- you have volunteered to enlist in the United States Navy.  By raising your right hand and taking the oath of enlistment, you have become a member of one of the most important military services in the world and joined one of the biggest businesses in the United States.  Not only have you proved your understanding of citizenship by offering your services to your country, but you have also taken the first step toward an exciting and rewarding career should you choose to remain in the Navy.</p>
<p>If you are not already familiar with names like John Paul Jones, Stephen Decatur, Doris Miller, William F. Halsey, and Marvin Shields, you soon will be.  And you will feel honored to be serving, as they once did, in the United States Navy.</p>
<p>Todayâ€™s Navy is a massive and complex organization, a far cry from the make-shift fleet that opposed the British in the Revolutionary War.  Hundreds of ships, thousands of aircraft, hundreds of thousands of people, and an annual budget in the billions of dollars go together to make the U.S. Navy a powerful and important component of the American defense establishment, playing a vital role in maintaining our national security, protecting us against our enemies in time of war, and supporting our foreign policy in peacetime.  Through its exercise of sea power, the Navy ensures freedom of the seas so that merchant ships can bring us the vital raw material we import from abroad, like petroleum, rubber, sugar, and aluminum.  Sea power makes it possible for us to use the oceans when and where our national interests require it, and denies our enemies that same freedom.  Sea power permits us to take the fight to the enemy when that is required, rather than waiting for the enemy to attack us in our homeland.</p>
<p>You are now a part of all that-a vital part, for the ships and aircraft of the Navy are only as good as the people who operate them (Cutler, 2009).</p>
