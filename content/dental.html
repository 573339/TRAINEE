        </ul>
        <li><span class="list-number">5.</span>Things you can do to help maintain your Dental health while in basic training:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste three times a day. If you can only brush once a day, rinse your mouth with water after meals and brush just before bed. Why before bed? When you are sleeping, the saliva (spit) in your mouth slows down and the protective “bathing” effect of saliva is reduced. Food remaining on your teeth can result in an increase of the cavity process. If you brush before going to bed, your reduced salivary flow will allow the fluoride in the toothpaste to remain in contact with the teeth for a longer period and stop or slow the cavity process.b. Floss your teeth at least once a day to remove the food and debris between your teeth. Leaving any material on a tooth surface for greater than a 24-hour period increases the risk of having this material become hardened (tarter/calculus). Once hardened it can only be removed by a Dental professional. You only floss the teeth you want to keep. Lack of flossing can lead to gum disease-the number one reason for tooth loss in adults.</li>
            <li><span class="list-number">c.</span>Pay attention to the things you eat during and after initial training. Some sodas, fruit drinks, desserts and snacks contain acids and up to 12 spoons of sugar. Your teeth are attacked for up to 20 minutes after consuming these items and your risk for developing tooth decay greatly increases. Limit snacking between meal and become informed about the acid and sugar content of the things you eat. Try eating fruits or vegetables for snacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="list-number">6.</span>Following graduation, your Dental care will continue.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="list-number">a.</span>Treatment not completed at Recruit Training Command will be continued at your next duty station.</li>
