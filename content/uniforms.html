          <li>NWU wear is authorized for commuting and normal tasks and associated stops (e.g. stops at child care, gas stations, off-base shopping, banking, DMV and dining) before, during and after the workday.</li>
          <li>NWUs are not a liberty uniform. Consumption of alcohol while off-base in NWUs is NOT PERMITTED.</li>

          <li>The Navy blue coverall occasion for wear shall be limited to an underway uniform (i.e. from stationing and securing the Sea and Anchor detail/maneuvering watch when leaving and entering port respectively).</li>
          <li>Commanding Officers can authorize the wear of Navy blue coveralls ashore in environments that place an excessive amount of wear on working uniforms.</li>

        <li><input type="text" class="form-control inline-form" data-save="3"> (PTU)</li>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>The PTU is designed primarily for group/unit physical training activities and the semi-annual Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA); however, it can be worn both on and off base for fitness and/or leisure unless determined otherwise by regional coordinators or commanding officers.</li>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>In-port and when performing command directed "group/unit" Physical training activities, semi- annual PFA (to include Body Composition Assessment (BCA) and Physical Readiness Test (PRT), the PTU shirt will be tucked into the shorts. Shorts will be worn fully on the waist. The length of the shorts will not extend below the top of the knee. Running shoes will be comfortable and support the planned exercise. Athletic socks must be worn and shall not extend above mid-calf. Low cut socks are permitted. Pregnant sailors will wear the shirt out and will discontinue wearing the PTU when it becomes too tight. Female sailors will wear a sport or dress brassiere when wearing the PTU. Additional undergarments are authorized.</li>
              <li>At sea, the wearing of the PTU will be at the discretion of the Commanding Officer. Requirements for female sailors remain as stated whether wearing the PTU or other personal fitness attire.</li>
              <li>During individual PT, shirts may be worn in or out of shorts. All other requirements are the same as "in-port".</li>
              <li>While on liberty, components of the PTU are authorized to wear individually or collectively. The PTU will not be worn while in a duty status or when conducting official business on base (e.g., PSD's, Medical treatment facilities, galleys, legal).</li>
              <li>The PTU is not authorized to be worn in lieu of the working, Service, or dress uniform while in a limited or light duty status.</li>
              <li>Optional components are provided for additional comfort and support. Long sleeved PTU shirts and/or navy knit watch caps are authorized when weather conditions warrant. Compression shorts/modesty liners are authorized but must not be visible while standing and will be either black or navy blue in color.</li>
              <li>In all cases, the PTU will be worn in such a manner so as to reflect credit upon the navy and the individual wearing the PTU.</li>
