  <li class="head-1">Background</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The CARE Program was established to assist recruits having trouble due to distressing personal backgrounds. These recruits often require individual, direct motivational counseling and guidance in addition to that delivered by the Recruit Division Commander (RDC).</li>
    <li>Information disclosed during CARE counseling is regarded as “privileged” and not “confidential”.</li>
  </ol>
  <li class="head-1">Discussion</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>If you are experiencing difficulty concentrating on training due to a traumatic event that happened before entering the Navy, CARE counselors are available to speak with you. They will assist you with generating the internal motivation needed to make it through basic training and inform you of available resources.</li>
    <li>Traumatic events that CARE counselors will take to you about include rape, molestation, sexual assault, recent loss of a loved one, abortion, or other personal crises that are preventing you from focusing on the requirements of basic training.</li>
    <li>CARE counselors WILL NOT talk to you about “A” school, homesickness, individual ratings, fleet experiences, recruiters, or RDCs (unless they have violated the Navy’s sexual harassment, equal opportunity, or discrimination policies).</li>
    <li>For situations beyond their training, CARE counselors will refer you to a qualified specialist.</li>
  </ol>
 
 <p>It is important to understand your sexual assault reporting options. Regardless of how you choose to report sexual assault, you will be offered a full range of advocacy, medical and counseling services. Remember, if you initially make a restricted report, you can change it to an unrestricted report at a later date. However, if you initially make an unrestricted report, it cannot be changed to a restricted report. If you do not initially select the most suitable reporting option, it may result in you having less control over the release of your personal information.</p>
