 <h2>A. Introduction</h2>
 <p>This laboratory will provide you with more intense hands-on training for mooring a ship to the pier and taking in mooring lines in preparations for getting the ship underway. The tour of the USS MARLINESPIKE will help you understand some of the shipboard conditions and familiarize you with the equipment learned from the Basic Seamanship classes.</p>

  <li class="head-2">Pier
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Bollards are found on the pier.</li>
      <li>The ship&#8217;s mooring lines are placed over the bollards.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Anchor and chain -- When dropped from the ship, the anchor restricts the motion of the ship.</li>
    <li class="head-2">Ship&#8217;s accommodation ladder
      <ol type="1">
        <li>The ship&#8217;s accommodation ladder is used to gain access to the quarterdeck from the pier. There will be a quarterdeck watch to grant permission to come aboard the ship.</li>
        <li>When at anchor, the accommodation ladder is rigged to the side of the ship with a platform at the bottom where small boats can tie up.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="head-2">Ship&#8217;s weather decks
      <ol type="1">

              <ol type="1">
                <li>Throw a life ring or life jacket into the water, if possible. Keep the person in sight. If a dye marker is available, drop it into the water.</li>
                <li>Point directly at the man overboard. Continue pointing until the personnel on the bridge have the man overboard in sight.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The officer of the deck (OOD) will maneuver the ship to a recovery position. At the same time, the word is passed twice over the 1MC announcing system, &ldquo;Man overboard, man overboard, port (starboard) side.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Six or more short blasts are sounded on the ship&#8217;s whistle.</li>
